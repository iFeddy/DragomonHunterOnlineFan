87|I must do something. They need my help!|
237|You're joking, right? That's WAY too much!|
238|Everything is of the highest quality, guaranteed! Well, why don't YOU name a price!|
239|I'll take any Dragocite you're willing to part with!|
240|Come, now—that doesn't even come CLOSE to the cost!|
241|Sorry, that's the best I can offer!|
242|Well, that's a bit out of my price range...|
243|Good, good—everything's in order!|
244|Excuse me, but you wouldn't happen to know where the testing area is, would you?|
245|Of course! It's right across the bridge. You can't miss it.|
246|S-... sorry to bother you, but I-... I seem to have forgotten where to... go... I have my weapon, but...|
247|Let me have a look at your form, dear.|
248|Ah, you're right where you're supposed to be! Just head over and speak with the examiner.|
249|Oh! Great! Thanks so much. |
250|I heard they're barely letting anyone in this year! They're being suuuuper strict.|
251|What?! But I alREADY thought it'd take a miracle for me to get in!|
252|Hey, what gives?!|
253|Yeah, haven't you ever heard of second chances? My, er, my hand slipped! Yeah! I should get a do-over!|
254|But, but, but... I've been dreaming of joining the Falcons my whole LIFE!|
255|I'm very sorry, but I'm afraid we can only let those who've passed the preliminaries inside the testing area.|
256|I expect nothing but your best today, recruits! Be proud! Be strong! Release your inner falcon!|
257|Only recruits who've completed the combat portion of their exam may enter the Ring of Trials.|
258|I-... I-... I did it! I really did it! I passed!|
259|This is like a dream-come-true! Me? A FALCON! And Mom said I'd never amount to anything!|
260|A D-D-Dragomon! Captain! What do we do?!|
261|Quite the unexpected turn of events. We stop it, of course! By any means necessary!|
262|Blast! It's... too strong...|
263|I can't... let it into the testing grounds...|
264|Wh-what? A recruit? What are... what are you doing here? You're going to get yourself killed!|
265|"So many bright-eyed, bushy-tailed recruits this year.#br#

269|Oh, MY! It's... it's... so BIG!|
270|It won't attack us, will it?!|
271|Hahaha! Never fear, good ladies! Articulo wouldn't hurt a flea!|
272|OHH!!|
273|Ahhh!!|
274|GUUURRAAOOR!!|
275|You must be AWFULLY brave and strong to have tamed such an eNORmous beast!|
276|You flatter me—truly! Though, frankly, I have more trouble fending off the throngs of ladyfolk who all want a taste of my unbridled virility.|
277|...|
278|I've told you once, and I've told you twice! MOVE, Bulkybeak! I'm gonna get an earful if I'm late AGAIN!|
279|Quack!|
280|Look, I already TOLD you! I'm NOT selling you to the butcher! That was just a JOKE last time!|
281|Quack quack!|
282|Ugh... I can hear the merchant yelling from here!|
283|If you don't follow me this instant, it's the pot for you! Don't think I wouldn't do it!!|
284|Qua-qua-qua-QUAAAAACK?!?  |

289|Come see! Come see! Stunning souvenirs at bargain-basement prices!|
290|Get 'em while you still can! All Dragomon puppets are priced to sell!|
291|What a splendid fight that was, my dear!|
292|The challenger's strategy was risky, but it paid off big! It's all or nothing, I always say!|
293|Hmm... will it be over soon?|
294|You don't like it? These tickets aren't cheap, you know!|
295|Welcome to the Hoppadrome! Only the most pulse-pounding action for our guests!|
296|What do you think of the next challenger?|
297|I doubt he even makes it to the next round!|
298|C'mon, let's get started! What are we waiting for!?|
299|Extra! Extra! Iron-Paw Eric is our new champion!|
300|Come have a look! We've got it all! Snacks... drinks... more snacks... everything!|
301|Care for something to drink? Drinks are on sale now!|
302|Mommy, mommy! Is the fight starting soon?|
303|Yes, my dear. Be patient!|
304|The Neverrealm Dragomon are no match for me!|
305|I'll be ruler of the Neverrealms!|
306|I've lost some good friends in the Neverrealms...|
307|Don't underestimate the Neverrealm Dragomon!|
308|Neverrealms are dangerous and mysterious places.|
309|Only a Warlord can ride this Dragomon.|
310|The Supreme Warlord could be the key to victory.|
311|Only a Centurion can ride this Dragomon.|
312|This Dragomon allows you to sneak up on enemies, as well as summon allies to launch surprise attacks.|
313|This Dragomon is a moving fortress—use it to break a stalemate!|
314|This Dragomon can heal any wound to keep your faction in tip-top fighting condition!|
315|The fight is at a stalemate. We need an advantage...|
316|But a mistake at this point could be fatal!|
317|You're right... So, what can we do?|
318|We should nominate one Warlord and two Centurions as our Battlefield Leaders.|
319|They shall certainly lead us to victory!|
320|Those elite Dragomon in the stronghold... are they for Battlefield Leaders?|
321|To strengthen our leaders and raise morale...|
322|We've invested countless resources into the war. There's no way we can lose!|
323|Back to the topic: we should ask the Mages to bring up our strategic map...|
324|As you can see, these are the locations of the bases.|
325|But taking over an enemy stronghold is no walk in the park...|
326|We've tried countless times without success.|
327|For now, let's focus on the five bases.|
328|As you can see, one of the bases is very close to our own stronghold.|
329|A bit further along we come to the second base. This marks the front lines of our forces.|
330|Both of us will stay behind to defend these bases.|
331|Though we can't necessarily prevent them from being captured, we are the greatest threat to hunters fighting on mounts.|
332|No one who crosses paths with us will survive!|
333|Hmm... I'd say the most important thing is defending the bases.|
334|Why?|
335|If you're defeated, our enemies will receive copious rewards and battleground feats.|
336|Accumulating battleground feats is the only way to fight on combat mounts.|
337|A defeat means more rewards for our enemies, which would allow them to build a large army of mounted troops.|
338|We'd never survive against that many mounts!|
339|I'll just have to take them all out, then!|
340|If I defeat someone on a mount, I can nab their mount for myself.|
341|True, but mounted units have a clear advantage over foot soldiers.|
342|Really?|
343|Indeed. One mounted unit could take out... four, five... who KNOWS how many foot soldiers!|
344|Then... how can we stop enemies from creating more mounted troops?|
345|That's the point...|
346|As mentioned, there are five bases on the battlefield, and each faction starts by controlling the two closest bases.|
347|This means capturing the central base is crucial to the opening stages of the battle.|
348|Sure. That's obvious! We have, at most, three portals available in our stronghold.|
349|We can warp to our two bases and the central base...|
350|So if we gain control of the central base, we'll gain control of the battlefield.|
351|Agreed. But if we lose the central base, the portal will be shut...|
352|If we gain control of enemy bases, can we open portals to them?|
353|Don't be ridiculous! Even the most powerful mages can't cover an ENTIRE battlefield.|
354|Ah...|
355|One more thing: the rewards you get from capturing a base are NOT instant.|
356|You need to defend the base for one minute before it's truly under your control. Don't leave until you've received your rewards!|
357|You can check the reward countdown in the Base Status window.|
358|So the rewards for capturing bases are calculated independently?|
359|Of course! It wouldn't be fair to give the same rewards to those quaking in their boots in the stronghold that we give to brave frontline warriors.|
360|Those who contribute the most to their faction's success will receive the highest rewards in return.|
361|Ah, good. So to get the real rewards, you have to get out there and fight!|
362|Very well. However, I still have one question... I think it's a question every hunter here would ask.|
363|Hmm? Well, stop muttering and spit it out!|
364|Uh... how can I make sure I get the most rewards?|
365|There are three methods: defeat enemies, capture bases, and defeat the NPCs defending enemy bases.|
366|So, if I quit in the middle of a battle... am I still entitled to my rewards?|
367|Don't worry—your contributions will not be forgotten!|
368|Ah, good. Fighting without a reward is a waste of time!|
369|Before I fight other factions, I should probably fight my hunger...|
370|Okay, let's get down to brass tacks! Let's see if the Warlord has any further instructions.|
371|If you still have questions, why not ask an experienced veteran?|
372|Hmph... Learn from those more experienced than you—it might save your skin!|
373|Hey! At last, the battle has begun. I can feel the earth shaking! Don't worry—we've got your back!|
374|Come on! Muster your courage, and look the enemy in the eye! Whether hunter or Dragomon, show no mercy!|
375|GO!!!|
376|You've saved me! May the blessing of the angels be upon you!|
377|You've saved me! May the blessings of the sorceresses be upon you!|
378|We've almost got 'er, boys! Let's take this glorified queen bee down!|
379|You shall not have him!|
380|Ahhh!!|
381|Leave this to me.|
382|Hmph!|
383|Stay back!|
384|If... if I only had my body... I could grant you my strength. You must save John!|

3265|Go tell Agatha back in the nest that we've got ourselves a real ogre here. I'll stay here and figure out what kind of improvements I need to make. |
3266|So, easy-peasy, right? Just place the traps at the designated points.|
3267|Ready? Let's go, then!|
3268|Place the traps|
3269|Hunt down Gerardus|
3270|Use the Trapper Sack to catch an otter|
3271|Use the Trapper Sack to catch a second otter|
3272|Use the Trapper Sack to catch the last otter|
3273|We're cornered! Help!|
3274|They've blocked every exit!|
3275|Falcons! Please, help us!|
3276|Whew... that was close.|
3277|I saw my life flash before my eyes!|
3278|You have our thanks.|
3279|Find the researchers.|
3280|Meet Atelia in Sporefall Core|
3281|Meet Atelia in the Ruined Laboratory|
3282|empty|
3283|Meet Agatha in Primeval Marsh|
3284|Protect Atelia|
3285|Ah, there you are, darling! Right on time. I'm not sure when these Deadeye Moombas started prowling around the laboratory, but they're certainly tenacious.|
3286|The Marsh Crocoturtles' territory is just ahead.|
3287|Here, take this meat with you. I trust you know what to do?|
3288|Could you be an absolute dear and take care of them for me?|
3289|F-... Feros did all this?|
3290|Why? Oh, Feros... what have you become?|
3291|Search for Feros|
3292|...you're right. Let's hurry!|
3293|Feros!|
3294|Nngh... F-Feros, no!|
3295|Nash?!|
3296|I sent the others on a wild goose chase. I'm the only one who knows the dragon is here.|
3297|Nash, you...|
3298|I'll always be here to fight by your side, Lenora. Now... do what you need to do!|
3299|Thank you, Nash... I think I have an idea of what to do.|
3300|Feros cannot hear my voice. He's been too consumed by hatred. I must diffuse his rage with powerful magicks if he is to become his old self again...|
3301|I will need your help, though, in keeping Feros at bay while I attempt to complete the spell.|
3302|Say no more!|
3303|That... that voice... could it... could it be? ...Lenora?|
3304|Oh, Feros!|
3305|It's so... good to see you again... Lenora...|
3306|I am glad as well, Feros.|
3307|Lenora... I-... nngh... I cannot go on much longer... Please...|
3308|No! Feros, you must fight it! You've finally regained your mind! You've finally regained your mind!|
3309|We... we still have so much to do... so many places to see... Just the two of us, Feros!|
3310|Lenora... you know as well as I this cannot be. I... I will soon... descend back into madness...|
3311|No! Feros... oh, Feros...|
3312|That day, so long ago, when the shamans apprehended me... I thought I had escaped, but I... was too weak...|
3313|I collapsed, and when I came to, I was in a cage, surrounded by... jeering faces. It was an auction house, Lenora... and I was to be sold.|
3314|I was bought by a cruel and petty human, who cursed and beat me daily. He treated me so cruelly... every day was worse than the last...|
3315|And my hatred... my hatred of humans grew and grew.|
3316|Before long, I was overcome with it. This hatred. It consumed my entire being. And as the waves of rage overtook me, I felt a power rise up like none I had ever felt before.|
3317|I killed him! I feasted on him! I was no longer to be a slave! No... I, FEROS, was the master!|
3318|I descended into a world of furor. Of rage! Of madness! The fury took control of my entire being, and I became that which I'd always feared I'd become—savage.|
3319|Oh, Feros... I'm so sorry... It's all my fault! I-... I-...|
3320|No, Lenora—you've saved me, as you did so long ago. I still remember you as the kind little girl who first befriended me.|
3321|Your kindness cleared the dark clouds from my mind and showed me the beauty of this world. But now... now, it's too late...|
3322|Hnngh... Lenora... I can feel the madness returning. You... you must kill me.|
3323|No! Feros... I-I can't! You're everything to me, Feros! You're everything to me, Feros!|
3324|Lenora, please... don't let the madness consume me once more... If I must die... I want it to be by your hand.|
3325|Please, Lenora... do this for me. I can feel it taking me... I...|
3326|I will do this, Feros, if it is your wish.|
3327|Thank you, Lenora. And goodbye, my dear friend...|
3328|Goodbye, Feros... Farewell...|
3329|Lenora…|
3330|Van?! H-... how long have you been here?|
3331|Van...|
3332|You were acting strange, so I followed you. I heard your whole conversation with Lenora.|
3333|Oh, uh... right...|
3334|Lenora, it's time to go back. Everyone is worried about you.|
3335|But Van, I... I let you down. I let everyone down! I don't deserve to be a Falcon...|
3336|Lenora, what makes you think you let me down?|
3337|I can't hunt! I can't... kill. I can't do anything!|
3338|No, you're wrong.|
3339|I'm... wrong? But...|
3340|Lenora, I would never force you to do something against your beliefs.|
3341|It's just... you never TOLD us! You never let us know what the problem was!|
3342|And, well... I guess it kinda felt like you didn't trust us.|
3343|Do you see, now, why I was disappointed?|
3344|Yes... I do, and... I promise I'll change. Can... can I come back? To the Falcons?|
3345|Of course. No matter how far you stray, the Falcon's Nest will always be your home.|
3346|Oh, Van.. Thank you! Thank y-... nngh...|
3347|Lenora will need some time to recover.|
3348|You two, bring the Eyedim Dragon's Dragocite back to Elysium. I'll stay with Lenora and bring her back once she's strong enough to walk.|
3349|Understood!|
3350|You... don't need any help with her, do you?|
3351|I've got her, Nash. It's fine.|
3352|A-... all right! I'll just, you know, take this back...|
3353|Take that!|
3354|Ha!|
3355|Protect the village!|
3356|None shall pass!|
3357|Watch out!|
3358|I swear I'll hit something with my next shot...|
3359|Bullseye! Haha!|
3360|Stay strong! I'll cover you!|
3361|Ah, lugnut! I think I set the timer too short... FIRE IN THE HOLE!|
3362|What the-?! What are YOU doing here?   What the-?! What are YOU doing here?  |
3363|Move your buns, unless you want 'em blasted off! Yeeeeeeehaaaaaww!|
3364|Blast. Surrounded. Wait a minute—what was that?|
3365|Help Nash weaken Feros|
3366|Help Lenora purify Feros|
3367|Listen to the conversation between Lenora and Feros|
3368|Show yourself! Just who do you think you are?!|
3369|Blighted thing! All right, you finish off those Tinderhawks. I'm gonna tail that shadow.|
3370|D-... don't come close! I was... ambushed...|
3371|Bain? Oh, Bain! What happened?! Are you all right?|
3372|There's... some kind of poison. Thank the maker it hasn't fully spread! I'll try to stave off its effects...|
3373|They were... hiding over there... in that bush...|
3374|A hunter! Help has arrived, boys! We can still pull through this!|
3375|Tch! Missed.|
3376|Those Boreasaurs are giving us a run for our money! Please, you must help us put a stop to them!|
3377|Oh, thank the maker! I thought I was dinofeed for sure!|
3378|I'd come out from there if I were you! Don't make me come in there!|
3379|How unfortunate! Seems my skills of stealth aren't all they're made out to be.|
3380|A lovely day to both of you! I hope you're having a SMASHING time! You Falcons are sooooo strong! Truly deserving of fame, yes?|
3381|Hush it before I hush YOU. Now, tell me! What are you trying to pull?|
3382|Pull? I'm not pulling anything! And certainly nothing nefarious, if that's what you mean.|
3383|You're not leaving until you talk.|
3384|Wha-...?! How did? How is...?!|
3385|Don't you walk away from me!  |
3386|I apologize. I thought by refusing to fight, I'd quell your rage. It seems I was mistaken!|
3387|Open your eyes! You've gotta tell me what happened!|
3388|Van, s-... stay away... It's a... a tr...|
3389|One Falcon, two Falcons, three Falcons, four! All bleeding out on the cold, hard floor! What a deLIGHTful tragedy!|
3390|Aha... hahaha... HAHAHA!! Poor little Falcons! Killed by a looooowly Dragomon! Who's to believe otherwise?! Huh?|
3391|Wh-... why do you... hate us so much?|
3392|Hate? Hate?! Whyever would I HATE you, dears? That would be like hating a bunch of little ANTS.|
3393|O noble Falcons, DO come save us! So magnanimous, the lot of you, yet you've no idea what a THORN you are in every other union's side.|
3394|If anything, we should have done this much sooner! Would have saved us time AND money.|
3395|But it's not worth crying over spilled milk, as they say. We'll have many more chances to PLAY, now...|
3396|It's almost romantic, actually. Looking out on you now... feebly fighting for your lives, crawling like worms in the snow. Would make a wonderful painting. Why, I could hang it in my room! "Falcon's Folly," I would call it. Has a nice ring to it, don't you think?|
3397|Are you done... running your mouth, yet?|
3398|This is your last chance... you hear me?! Get the HELL out of here...|
3399|Or the next thing out of your mouth... will be your tongue... after my axe goes through your head!|
3400|Wh-why can he still move?! KILL him! Kill him, NOW!|
3401|Dear me. I guess I don't know my own strength sometimes...|
3402|You realize you've just made a declaration... declaration of war, right? Or did that slip your mind, too?|
3403|If I were you, I'd turn on those pretty little heels of yours... and GET OUT of here.|
3404|Y-... you useless, incompetent-...!!|
3405|P-please just... just calm down! I'm NOT your enemy!|
3406|SHUT UP! Draw your weapon, now! If you win, I'll let you go!|
3407|A pity, but I'm afraid this conversation is over.|
3408|I'll let you go... THIS time!|
3409|Just remember this—we will never... NEVER give up.|
3410|What are you doing?! Stand up straight!|
3411|Try anything and it'll be the last thing you do! |
3412|I've got my eye on you!|
3413|E-... everything's gone out of control! Retreat! Retreat!|
3414|Forgive me!|
3415|Please... spare me...|
3416|Yeesh, these guys are insane! |
3417|I'll deal with this charlatan. You finish off the rest.|
3418|Tch...|
3419|So... dizzy...|
3420|Wh-... who are you? Where am I?|
3421|What? Gone? That's impossible!|
3422|You'll have to forgive me for taking my leave. We shall see each other again soon.|
3423|She got away...|
3424|That was too close for comfort...|
3425|If it wasn't for you, we'd be...|
3426|B-b-behind you! More of them!|
3427|There are, uh... slightly more of them than I expected...|
3428|Caught between a crab and a hard place, are we?|
3429|Wh-...? Where are they going?!|
3430|No way! It's Agatha! Agatha Spectrall!|
3431|You think you're getting away?|
3432|Hmph!|
3433|It's a trap!|
3434|Yeeeeouch!|
3435|Never fear, my dear! The insuperable dragonmeister Nash shall save you!|
3436|Let the show begin!|
3437|And now for the glorious finale!|
3438|May the last curtain fall!|
3439|Ohoho!|
3440|Stunned into silence, no doubt, by my alluring artistry, are we?|
3441|And what brings such an adorable fledgling like you to me?|
3442|The wyvern's about to attack!|
3443|Keep your eye on the red arrows—they reveal the path of its next attack.|
3444|Press "R" to roll out of harm's way!|
3445|This lean, mean, crabby fighting machine means business!|
3446|Back up when it's about to use its devastating Pincer Whirlwind attack!|
3447|Roll to safety when it readies its bubbly but deadly Bubble Burst attack!|
3448|Dare to be David and take this Goliath down! Crab legs are on the menu tonight!|
3449|Accept assignments via the Hunters' League bulletin board.|
3450|Then, use the nearby portal to teleport instantly to the venue for your assignment.|
3451|Completing assignments will earn you crafting materials (and some cold, hard cash, too!).|
3452|Assignments change daily, so be sure to check the board often for new jobs!|
3453|The Hoppadrome is a long-standing tradition in Elysium.|
3454|Step into the ring solo or with a party and go toe-to-toe with the world's most powerful Dragomon!|
3455|Solo entry requires silver tickets. They can be obtained by completing assignments from the Hunters' League.|
3456|To enter as a party, you'll need gold tickets. These can only be obtained by completing party assignments from the Hunters' League.|
3457|Test your valor in a competition of strength and fortitude like no other!|
3458|You'll never be able to up your hunting game without powerful gear.|
3459|Collect materials by completing assignments and taking down Dragomon.|
3460|Harris can help you recast those materials into fashionable but oh-so-deadly gear!|
3461|The stronger the Dragomon you fell, the rarer the materials you can find.|
3462|Set your sights high and work towards crafting the ultimate set of gear!|
3463|Dragocite can be obtained from defeated Dragomon or purchased from Chandler.|
3464|Once you've collected enough, take it to Harris for a bit of transformational tomfoolery!|
3465|Inlay Dragocite into your gear to unleash its untapped fury!|
3466|#&7$%n%##br#
 %p% stares down at your Pincerpod, eyes aglint. You're half-afraid they're#br#
 about to butter and boil the giant crustacean on the spot! You quickly step#br# forward and ask what's going through that tiny, hare brain of theirs.#char$$821$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Is it just me, or... has your Pincerpod put on a few pounds? Tell me it's not just me!"#br#
 %p%'s eyes narrow further, as though staring into the very soul of your Pincerpod#br#
 itself.#pets100+30$$1$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Taken aback by %p%'s observation, you turn your own eyes towards the portly#br#Pincerpod and take note that it is, indeed, considerably more corpulent than you last#br#
 remembered (admittedly, you find it a bit endearing). #M016010s50+20$Pincerpod$1$$1$0#

#&7$Pincerpod##br#
 The Pincerpod, subsequently, seems to notice your attention, and turns its head#br#
 towards you, pincers chomp, chomp, chomping away at its midday meal. It quickly#br#
 becomes disinterested, though, and turns somewhat languidly back towards it trough.   #M016010s50+20$Pincerpod$4$$1$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"Yeesh, %n%! Is that YOUR Pincerpod? I've heard about people that spoil their#br#
 Dragomon, but this takes the cake! Literally! You don't FEED him cake, do you?"#br#Agatha's voice comes out of nowhere from behind you, her patent-pending,#br#capillary-freezing, demoralizing timbre sending a shiver up your spine. #M320090$Agatha$4$$0$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
 Agatha walks over to get a better look at your Pincerpod, arms crossed over her chest#br#
as she hums softly to herself. "Strange, but I've suddenly got a hankering for crab soup.#br#
 Shame that my own Pincerpod's like a hollowed-out exoskeleton, but meh! It'll do, I suppose..."#br#She nods her head as though agreeing with herself.

#&7$%n%##br#
 You watch her walk off, rather flabbergasted yourself as to what she was even doing#br#here—the Agatha YOU know would sooner purposefully trip you than talk to you like#br#a decent human being—while simultaneously fearing for both the life of your and#br#Agatha's pet Pincerpods.

#&7$%p%##br#
 Once she's out of earshot, %p% turns to you, their eyes wide and trembling with#br#
 barely-restrained tears. "You... you wouldn't make soup out of your Pincerpod, would#br# you, %n%?"
 #pets100+30$$823$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You shake your head vehemently, assuring your overwrought companion that#br#
 you would—of course—never DREAM of boiling your own pet alive.#char$$821$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
 It takes a few minutes of convincing before %p% finally accepts your assertions,#br#
 but eventually, they've seemed to calm down somewhat, and they go back to watching#br#your Pincerpod shovel food between its maxillipeds. #M016010s50+20$Pincerpod$1$$1$0#|
3467|#&7$%p%##br#
"I TOLD you! He's NOT for SALE!"#pets100+30$$831$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You've just been out taking a much-needed stroll around your ranch when a pair of#br# bickering voices reaches your ears. Curious as to who these mysterious persons could#br#
 be—you don't get visitors often!—you turn towards the direction of the commotion#br#and hasten your step.#char$$301$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"I don't care about the money! I don't care about any of that! You got it?"#br#
 When you arrive, you find a red-faced %p% standing between Marvin#br#and your Wingrus with their arms splayed to either side.#pets100+30$$831$$1$0#

#&7$Marvin##br#
"Yeah? And how's about if I made you an offer you couldn't refuse, see?"#br#
 Marvin digs in one of his pockets and procures what you can only imagine must be#br#a new amount of currency. He sidles up beside %p%, one arm around the other rabbit's#br#shoulder, and suggestively tosses the coins in the air, one by one. #M812010s100+30$Marvin$831$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
 %p% seems at a loss, their eyes hypnotized by the rotating ring of golden coins.#br#
 Th-they can't seriously be considering it, can they? You have no idea what "it" could#br#
 be, but nothing that involves Marvin EVER turns out good! Just as you feel they're#br#
about to crumble, they quickly shake their head, eyes clenched shut. "No is NO!"#pets100+30$$825$$1$0#

#&7$Marvin##br#
"You're a hard bun to crack, you know that, kid? But I'm no fool! I know when to quit!"#br# Marvin shrugs his shoulders and draws back, letting the coins clink back into his#br#
 pocket with lonely, metallic clanks. "Guess I'll have to find someone else willing#br#
to cut me a deal."#M812010s100+30$Marvin$301$$0$0#

#&7$Winged Walrus##br#
 You watch Marvin slink off, then approach %p%. %p%, however, still hasn't#br#
 noticed you. They've turned, now, lip quivering as they gaze lovingly at the fat,#br# purple, winged walrus (of whom is currently staring vacuously into space). #M058010s50+10$Winged Walrus$1$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"I... just turned down... a FORTUNE! A FORTUNE, I tell you! B-but I'm stronger than#br# that! My love for YOU is stronger than that! I would never—not in a million, million#br#
 years!—sell your tusks! No matter how much ANYone offers me!"
  
 #pets100+30$$827$$1$0#

#&7$Winged Walrus##br#
 The Wingrus looks—at first—confused, and then simply disenchanted. Finally,#br#
 he raises his whiskered jowls and lets out a sharp bark. %p%, in turn, reaches a#br#
 tiny, furry hand to scratch the Wingrus behind his non-existent ears. #M058010s50+10$Winged Walrus$2$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Marvin had... Marvin had been trying to get %p% to sell him your Wingrus's#br#
 TUSKS?! Just what kind of cruel, malicious person would DO such a thing?! Then you#br#remember who you're talking about...#char$$806$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 As you watch %p% and your Wingrus stare into each other's eyes, however, you#br#
 can practically feel the puerile love threaded between them—palpable and bovine.#br#
 Not wanting to ruin such a serene moment, you quickly skitter off and leave the#br#
 two mismatched love birds to their own devices.#char$$1$$0$0#|
3468|#&7$%p%##br#
 You're out at work on your ranch with %p%—the two of you busy feeding your#br#
 sprightly mons—when something woefully disharmonious to the norm catches your#br#
 attention. It's just as you're about to feed your Rhinosker that you notice it—someone#br#uninvited! And they're standing just beside your Rhinosker's pen. #M805010s100+30$Mholt$1$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Mholt? Hey, Mholt! Is that you? What're you doing here?"#br# And, indeed, it is the follicley-challenged Hoppalong, but he#br#doesn't appear to have noticed your approach.#pets100+30$$831$$0$0#

#&7$Mholt##br#
"Look at it... just LOOK at it... s-so luscious... so full of life..."#br#
 Mholt's hands reach towards your Rhinosker, visibly trembling,#br#
 before drawing back as though burned with a hot poker.#br#
 He continues to mumble incoherently to himself. #M805010s100+30$Mholt$1$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Hey, uh, Mholt? Mhooooooolt..." %p%'s big, doleful eyes blink in curious inquiry#br# as they sidle up beside Mholt. When the small, gray Hoppalong remains oblivious#br# as they sidle up beside Mholt. When the small, gray Hoppalong remains oblivious#br# and abruptly scream in Mholt's ear.
  
 #pets100+30$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Mholt##br#
"Good LORD! What's all this howling and wailing! For God's SAKE, man! I'm standing#br#
 right here! There's no need to bend the cilia back, as it were." Mholt takes a dazed#br#
step backwards and massages his drooping ears. "What would I have done had you#br# scared the very hair from my pores? Yes, how would you have felt then, hm?"
   #M805010s100+30$Mholt$823$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Coming from someone who spends every minute of every day pulling their own#br# hair out already, I find that statement more than a bit ludicrous, but that's besides#br# the point! What are you doing staring at our Rhinosker like you're about to take#br#
 a chomp out of its backside?" #pets100+30$$831$$0$0#

#&7$Mholt##br#
"Don't make me out like some kind of bloodthirsty carnivore! I was just, well, you see..."#br# Mholt's eyes dance back and forth between %p% and the Rhinosker, and you can see#br#
 his hands once more begin to twitch. "A-all that hair... that beautiful... gorgeous...#br#voluminous HAIR!"#M805010s100+30$Nafus$2$$1$0#

#&7$Rhinosker##br#
 Your Rhinosker's seventh sense—the one reserved for sensing threats to its luscious#br#
 locks, mind you—must have begun tingling, because the hairy beast abruptly rears#br#
 its head back and lets out an F5-level sneeze. Thick gobs of gelatinous mucus spring#br# forth from its nostrils and rain down on Mholt's tiny body like snot grenades. #M088010s40+20$Rhinosker$2$$0$0#

#&7$Mholt##br#
Mholt stands motionless for a moment—shell-shocked, no doubt—then brings his#br# paws up to analyze the damage. Gooey, yellowed muck slides down between his#br# quivering fingers to form pools on the ground below. "That was... that was..."#br#
 You're half-afraid Mholt is going to faint on the spot. #M805010s100+30$Mholt$825$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"C-cripes! I'm sorry, Mholt! I don't know WHAT'S gotten into him today. He's normally#br# so docile..." %p% turns towards the Rhinosker, finger wagging. The Rhinosker,#br#
 however, simply turns its head in the other direction and takes a voracious bite#br# of its freshly-laid fodder.
  
 #pets100+30$$822$$0$0#

#&7$Mholt##br#
"It's... it's fine, truly! I-... I just simply... it's, well, you know! We all have our... our off#br# days, yes..." Mholt attempts to squeegee the thick, glossy mucus from his arms, legs,#br# and ears as he backs up one step after another. "B-but I really, REALLY must be going#br#
 now, yes? Need to... to wash this... this vile substance from m-my precious hair..."

 Upon saying this, Mholt turns on his heels and scuttles off as fast as his (gooey) bunny#br#
legs can take him. %p% turns back towards the Rhinosker, hands on their hips.#br#
 "What am I gonna do with you, huh? You can't just go around sneezing on people#br#like that! It's gross, is what it is! Haven't you ever heard of a tissue?" #M088010s40+20$Rhinosker$1$$1$0#

#&7$Rhinosker##br#
 Your Rhinosker, however, seems as aloof as ever, tilting its head first, then giving its#br#
 feet a few restless stomps. Finally, it taps its now empty food trough with the tip of#br#its horn—a clear-enough signal if you ever saw one! #M088010s40+20$Rhinosker$4$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#

"Man, don't you know people are walking around here? You can't just#br# go around digging holes. People can fall in! It's dangerous!"#br#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Enough with the scratching already! You're even making ME feel itchy...#br# Uh-oh. I just felt something crawl on me!" %p% starts to scratch themselves.#br#
 Between %p% and the otter, you feel like you're watching an episode of Itchee and Scratchee.
  
 #pets100+30$$823$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Ahhh! Now I've got fleas, thanks to you!#br# This sucks! So itchy!!!" %p% starts running and#br#
 jumping like crazy, trying to shake the fleas off.
  
 #pets100+30$$825$$1$0#

"Pshaw! EATing me? Nonsense! That Raptite and I go way back!#br# I was just trying to help it get rid of a bone stuck in its throat! Look!"#br# %p% shows you the tiny bone still clutched in their paw.

"Hey! Don't worry! I wasn't gonna actually DO anything...#br# I'm just saying! Your 'pet'... looks like it has some awesome, juicy meat!#br# It's a compliment! Omi can't take his eyes off the Fellswine, and he brings#br#

"Pincey claims that she's actually a princess!#br#

"I'm not human, so I can't help her, so I suggested she give YOU a try..."#br#

 Taking insults from a Pincer Drone about your personal bits is not#br#

"I believe I can fly! Just gotta cut down on eating pie!"
 #pets100+30$$303$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You half-understand.#br#
 Could it be that %p% wants to lose a few pounds?#br#
 What's all that about learning to fly, though?#br#
 You've never seen a Hoppalong fly... no matter WHAT the song claims.#char$$825$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 It's probably best you remind %p% of the laws of nature before they jump#br#

 break it to them that they'll never learn to fly.#char$$821$$0$0#

#&7$Shockondor##br#
 The Shockondor crows loudly, beating its wings with heavy gusts.#br#
 It looks pumped, but how it thinks it's going to get airborne is anyone's guess. #M010010s50$Shockondor$4$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Our Shockondor has been rather blue as of late. I think it's jealous because it#br#
 can't fly like all the other birds. But I think that—seeing as it has wings—it MUST#br#
 be able to fly! It just needs to practice!"#pets100+30$$831$$1$0#

 %p% and the Shockondor are obviously pretty confident, but it#br#
 seems obvious to you that the bird will never fly. It's just not built#br#

 The Fungal Croaker, meanwhile, seems fine. It's certainly looking a lot calmer#br#

"Wh-what the...?! Now I don't even know WHAT'S happening! You're eating#br# you own fungus?" While %p% stares on in shock, the fungus on the Croaker's#br#

 its head, sag its shoulders, and continue its drawn out, overdramatic farewell. #M078010s30+30$Ironshell Drone$1$$0$0#

"I don't know either.#br#

 All you can do is to turn your head away and pray for the best.#pets100+30$$823$$0$0#|
3486|#&7$%p%##br#
"Hahaha! That's fantastic! Is that true?#br#
 Alright! I'll tell %n%! You can count on me!"#br#
 While you're busy at the Ranch,#br#
 %p% is passing the time chatting with a good friend called 'Karl', a Fen Croaker.#pets100+30$$821$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
“Hey, %n%. Karl wanted me to tell you that he's looking for a companion.#br#
 Can you help him find one?"#br#
 %p% asks you while pulling at your clothes, as they always do to get your attention..#char$$1$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You reply to %p% that you need to expand the Ranch first.#br#
 If they really want to help Karl to find a companion, %p% should focus first on working. #br#
 Maybe once all the work is done you can find Karl a mate.
 You give %p% a rake and tell them to get to work.#char$$821$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"..." %p% catches the rake and throws it aside.#br#
"Karl! Oh Karl... I'm sorry, but you're too young to be getting yourself a companion!#br#
 I should get one first, cause I'm older!#br# Seems like %p% has found an excuse not to work. They seem very satisfied,#br#
 wearing a smug expression that says "I dare you to say something".  #pets100+30$$831$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 %p%'s rude behavior fills you with despair. You turn back to work, with a sigh. You don't really have time for %p%'s childish games.#br#
 Suddenly, someone behind you yelps in pain.#br#
 Then %p% rolls over to you.#char$$826$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"What are you doing, Karl? That hurts!"#br#
 %p% whines.#pets100+30$$825$$0$0#

#&7$Fen Croaker##br#
 Karl turns toward to the rake,#br#
 and pulls it back towards him with his tongue. #M101010s25+20$Fen Croaker$4$$1$0#

#&7$Fen Croaker##br#
"Ribbit... Ribbit... Ribbit..."#br#
  You can't believe what you've just seen.  It seems like Karl is trying hard #br#
 to pick up the rake and work, so desperate is he for your help. #br# But he can barely grasp it in his short, chubby hands. #M101010s25+20$Fen Croaker$2$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
 Only now does %p% realize how rude his behavior was.#pets100+30$$823$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Karl... I'm so sorry... Karl, you're my favorite."#br#
 %p% apologizes to Karl.#br#
"I shouldn't have acted so nastily. I must have picked it up from%n%.#br#
 You deserve better. Please give me another chance. Will you forgive me?"#pets100+30$$822$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
 %p% walks towards Karl, picking up the rake from the ground.#br#
"Don’t worry Karl, I will make your wishes come true.#br#
 Let's leave %n% alone. We don't need their help, anyway..."#pets100+30$$821$$0$0#

#&7$Fen Croaker##br#
 Karl seems to believe %p%,#br#
 because the look he gives you when he looks at you is one of disgust and hatred.
   #M101010s25+20$Fen Croaker$4$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You shrug helplessly. #br#
 What can you do? Sometimes you wonder whether you and%p% were really a #br#
 good match after all. #char$$826$$1$0#|
3487|#&7$%p%##br#
"One, two, three, four, five. Once I caught a fish alive!"#br#
 %p% sings, while sprinkling fish food.#pets100+30$$821$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Frustrated with your increasingly huge workload at the Ranch,#br#
 you ask %p% to come over to help clean up the animal droppings.#char$$821$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"%n%, I'm too weak. Plus, how could you ask me to do such a horrible, disgusting and demanding job?#br#
 Look at me. I can barely feed the fish."#br#
 %p% tries to lift the fish food, showing you that it is too heavy to carry,#br#
 and shows you a pathetic expression.#pets100+30$$831$$1$0#

#&7$Slithering Dragolizard##br#
 The Slithering Dragolizard swirls around its pool, splashing water everywhere,#br#
 including on %p%. It pokes its head out of the water, giving a spine chilling roar. #M035010s40+55$Slithering Dragolizard$2$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Hey! Give it a rest, will ya?!
 %p% is now completely soaked. He throws the fish food on the floor angrily.#br#
"Fine! You know what? I'm done with this!"#pets100+30$$825$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You immediately stop what you're doing to run and try and console the sodden %p%.#char$$821$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Stop trying to cheer me up! Can't you see I'm half drowned? #br#
 Wouldn't you be upset too?"#br#
 answers the despondent%p%, wringing their paws.#pets100+30$$825$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You laugh at %p%'s reply#br#
 and say that you often have the same feeling when %p% is having fun while you're hard at work.#char$$824$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"You mean my singing? You have a problem with it?#br#
 Well, you're just going to have to learn to live with it--I have a big concert coming up#br#
 at the Hoppalong Club. And I'm dancing as well! So ha!"
 %p% starts to talk endlessly.#pets100+30$$821$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Just as you're starting to zone out, #br#
 The Slithering Dragolizard leaps fully out of the water,#br#
 swings its tail elegantly in the air,#br#
 and slaps %p% full across the face. #M035010s40+55$Slithering Dragolizard$30001$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Ouch! Grr... argh!"#br#
 %p% falls over sideways,#br#
 and lies motionless on the ground.#pets100+30$$504$$1$0#

#&7$Slithering Dragolizard##br#
 The Slithering Dragolizard pops its head out of the water and#br#
 giggles at you. You could even swear it gave you a wink!#br#
 He seems to be so proud and delighted of what he's done. #M035010s40+55$Slithering Dragolizard$4$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You give the Slithering Dragolizard a sneaky thumbs up,#br#
 and continue with what you were doing. As for %p%, still motionless on the ground,#br#
 you figure you'll finish dealing with the animal droppings, then tend to your companion. #br#
 You have your priorities in order.#char$$806$$1$0#|
3488|#&7$%n%##br#
 Something strange is afoot-- you've noticed that small things keep going missing at the ranch.#br#
 None of the missing materials have been anything valuable,#br#
 but it still irks you to have a thief running about.#char$$826$$0$0#

#&7$Spyrosaur##br#
"Roaawwwrrr!!"#br#
 A Spyrosaur hops up to you and gives a cute miniature roar. #M053010s40+10$Spyrosaur$2$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You pat his head but he's not looking for a petting. Instead, he pulls insistently at your clothes.#br#
 It seems like he wants you to follow him.#br#
 You follow as he leads you over to the other side of the Ranch. #M053010s40+10$Spyrosaur$4$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You wonder to yourself what could be going on. Spyrosaurs are usually very solitary--#br#
 so much so they're sometimes called "Shyrosaurs". One wouldn't usually approach a human#br#
 without good reason. But then it occurs to you that Spyrosaurs are also known to hoard objects#br#
 they find. Perhaps this could be somehow related to the missing objects?#char$$1$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 If the Spyrosaur trusts you enough to show you where its stash is,#br#
 that must mean you share a really close connection, right?#br#
 You feel a warmth deep in the cockles of your heart.#br#
 You've made friends with a Shyrosaur! That's not easy!#char$$806$$0$0#

#&7$Spyrosaur##br#
"Roar...."#br#
 The Spyrosaur suddenly stops and starts to roar softly. You look in the direction it's gesturing #br#
 and notice a small figure ahead sitting on the ground, fiddling with something. #M053010s40+10$Spyrosaur$4$$1$0#

#&7$Small Figure##br#
"Hehe... here's some more good stuff from that dopey %n%,#br#
 and a special colored egg from the Spyrosaur. Hehehe...#br#
 As soon as I sell all the stolen goods,#br#
 I'll be able to buy myself a new toy gun and join in Simón's gunfight game."#pets100+30$$824$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You look closely. Isn't that %p%...? What the...?#br#
 They are giggling and rifling through the bag, still unaware they're being watched.#br#
 Everything's becoming clearer now!#char$$823$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
 %p% seems to have noticed that someone is standing behind him.#br#
 They stiffly turn around and look at you, shuffling awkwardly.#br#
 So much for that toy gun... #pets100+30$$3$$1$0#|
3489|#&7$%p%##br#
My Lurker friends! Listen, and you shall hear a great story!#br#
 %p% rushes into the Swampfang Lurker stables with a story book,#br#
 clears their throat, and tries very hard to tell a story to the Lurkers inside.#pets100+30$$821$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Stories for Lurkers? You hope %p% has a good book, otherwise their audience may try #br#
 to eat the storyteller. However, they seem surprisingly receptive, pricking up their ears in anticipation.#char$$823$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Long, long ago, there was a young Hoppalong hunter who would always go on solitary quests.#br#
 One day, out adventuring, he came upon a legendary cave where three dragons lived,#br#
 and decided to look for the lost crown rumored to be inside."#pets100+30$$831$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Hey! You three can't just sit there and look dumb! Act out the story!#br#
 Come on! Show me what the three dragons look like! I'm trying to EGOT here."#br#
 %p% throws the storybook down and tells off the three Lurkers.#pets100+30$$831$$0$0#

#&7$Swampfang Lurker##br#
 One of the Lurkers burps, as if to show off his fire-breathing skills.#br#
 A horrible smell of algae and rotten fish
 filters through the room. #M102010s50$Swampfang Lurker$4$$1$0#

#&7$Swampfang Lurker##br#
 The second Lurker spits on the floor,#br#
 as if to indicate that he is a water dwelling dragon. #M102010s50$Swampfang Lurker$3$$1$0#

#&7$Swampfang Lurker##br#
 The last Swampfang Lurker tilts his head and looks menacingly at the other two,#br#
 smiling disturbingly with bared yellow tusks.#br#
 Apparently, this is his way of showing everyone he's the dragon that deals physical attacks. #M102010s50$Swampfang Lurker$4$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Good! Very well performed! Very expressive. That EGOT may yet be mine."#br#
 %p% smiles happily and flips to the next page.#pets100+30$$822$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"So the Hoppalong hunter found three dragons in the dark cave...#br#
 then she kissed... the dragon princess lying on the crystal coffer...#br#
 and lived happily ever after... Wait a second. Kissed?"#br#
 %p% starts to shudder and crumples up the story pages.#pets100+30$$831$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"What the devil is this!#br#
 Who wrote this terrible story? Who even published this book?"#br#
 %p% throws the book on the ground. There, on the back cover, staring back up at %p%, #br#
 is a picture of its author. To %p%'s shock and horror it is none other than  Agatha!#pets100+30$$825$$0$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"Well, well, well! What have we here? Some Hoppalong's got a problem with my storybook? #br#
 I come here one time and you're throwing my work around and cursing me behind my#br#
 back, are you? Get over here, you cretinous Philistine!" #M320090$Agatha$4$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Cursing? Why, no, you must have misheard! I love the book! I was just... I was...#br# Er... Dancing! Yes, that's right, I was dancing.#br# I love the book so much it makes me want to dance! Anyway, what's that over there? Gotta go!#br# %p% tries to flee, but is caught and held firmly by one of the Lurkers.#br#
      
  
 #pets100+30$$821$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Agatha turns around and stares at you angrily.#br#
 You stammer, swearing you have nothing to do with the incident.#br#
 But you're so terrified that your legs are already giving way.#char$$821$$0$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"Listen up, you two UTTER NINNIES... Now you're going to find out
 what happens#br#
 when you insult people behind their backs!" #br#
 Agatha takes out her Dual Blades and walks over to you. You feel your liver quiver...#br# #M320090$Agatha$351$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Now... Burnardo, Mobius and Spectro, all ferocious beasts in their day, all seem tame enough now...#br#
 Even man-eating Apollo is now happy to hug and play with humans!#char$$802$$0$0#|
3490|#&7$%p%##br#
"So, it's clear... With professional training, even the most ferocious beasts can be tamed.#br#
 However! Their wild nature will always remain in their blood.#br#
 This is why beasts are called beasts. '#br#
 What the...? Why do they only write nonsense in 'Hunter's Magazine'?"#pets100+30$$831$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
 %p% throws the magazine to the floor,#br#
 and angrily kicks it away.#pets100+30$$825$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You walk up to %p% and ask what's happened.#br#
 %p% looks upset, sitting on the ground and wearing a scowl.#char$$821$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"I too was once a wild beast, with my own life and dreams... but ever since I started to accompany you...#br#
 I feel more like a performing puppet...I've been TAMED!"#br#
 %p% looks at you with a sad expression.#pets100+30$$831$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 After listening to %p%'s complaint,#br#
 you go unlock the Pantherus cage,#br#
 and ask %p% to challenge the Pantherus. #M029010s50$Pantherus$1$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"What? Are you nuts? Howie is my good friend.#br#
 I don't wanna fight him! What's wrong with you!"#br#
 %p% replies, looking at you like you're losing your marbles.#pets100+30$$823$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You ignore %p% and focus, instead, on the Pantherus,#br#
 urging him to attack your companion. #M029010s50$Pantherus$2011$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Oh, no! Howie! Stop it!"#br#
 %p% takes out their weapon instinctively and—in an instant—gives#br#
 the Pantherus a huge slash that sends it reeling.#pets100+30$$2011$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Oh, no! Howie... Stay with me...#br#
 I swear I didn't want to kill you! It all happened so fast!#br#
 I couldn't help it! You know I'm a hunter!"#br#
 %p% starts to cry over the Pantherus's dead body.#pets100+30$$827$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You slowly walk over to %p% and say this is simply an instinct.#br#
 No one can take it away. It's there in the wild beast blood and can't be removed.#br#
 Even merchants will fight if they have to. It's the law of nature.#char$$821$$1$0#

#&7$Pantherus##br#
 Meanwhile, the Pantherus seems to be showing signs of life. #br#
 He crawls over and places a claw on top of %p%'s head.#br#
 It looks like he's trying to tell %p% that he's all right after all! #M029010s50$Pantherus$3$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"I get it now! Thanks, Howie. #br#
 If it weren't for you, #br#
 I would probably have thought that I'd been completely tamed by %n%." #pets100+30$$831$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
 %p% wipes away the tears and stands up.#br#
"From today, I shall be reborn. I will work even harder to be %n%'s best possible companion.#br#
 I'll help %n% as best I can, and quit fooling around!"#pets100+30$$824$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 %p%'s passion had been ignited. #br#
 All night long, you heard them training and practicing with various weapons at the Ranch. #char$$1$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 However, by the next morning, %p% goes back to chasing ducks... #br#
 You suppose that's %p%'s true talent...#br#
 Your trusty companion.#pets100+30$$303$$0$0#|
3491|#&7$%n%##br#
 The weather seems to be nice today.#br#
 It's a good day for working on the Ranch.#br#
 There's a lot to do,#br#
 and you don't really trust %p% to handle it.#char$$806$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"You think you'll escape me by flying high? Haha!!"#br#
 From afar, you look over to see %p% chasing after a Mothrake with a stick.#pets100+30$$824$$1$0#

#&7$Mothrake##br#
 The Mothrake flaps its wings, sprinkling powder everywhere. #M039010s40$Mothrake$4$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You rush over to try to stop %p%.#br#
 Scale powder is poisonous and
 %p% could get hurt if they aren't careful.#char$$821$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Hey! %n%, what are you doing? Leave me be!#br#
 I'm helping Randy Moth do some exercise! They've been sleeping for too long.#br#
 I don't want them to get fat!"#br#
 %p% shouts at you angrily.#pets100+30$$825$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You explain to %p% carefully about Mothrake living habits.#br#
 They are usually asleep at this time of day. It's completely natural.#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Moreover, when threatened, Mothrakes start to sprinkle deadly poisonous scale powder.#br#
 %p% should be more careful. That's why they say to let sleeping Moths lie!#char$$821$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"What the... poison me?!#br#
 But I was doing it for their sake!#br#
 Oh bhy god, gedidoff me! I'b too yuggh to darghhh! #br#
 %p% is losing the ability to speak, their lips swelling up like balloons. #pets100+30$$823$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You laugh out loud at %p%'s swollen lips.#br#
 Now their left eyelid is beginning to swell shut, too!#br#
 %p% is looking more and more like a crazy gargoyle from the times of old.#char$$824$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
 %p%, meanwhile is starting to freak out.#br#
 They try putting their head in a bucket of water, but quickly scream, as they learn#br#
 the hard way that water only worsens the poison's effects.#pets100+30$$2$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Now, when %p% turns their face to you, what you see chills you to the bone.
 You aren't laughing anymore. %p% is barely recognizable. They look like something#br#
 you'd see hanging at a butcher shop. Stretching its hands like a zombie, the unfortunate creature #br#
 stumbles towards you, shrieking in agony.#char$$823$$0$0#|
3492|#&7$%p%##br#
"What is it you keep writing in that notebook, %n%?#br#
 Every time I see you, it seems like you're taking lots of notes.#br#
 What are you doing, trying to develop cold fusion? You look like a dork."#br#
 %p% points at your prized hunting notebook.#pets100+30$$831$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You explain to %p% that you're writing in your hunting notebook.#br#
 That's where you write down all the habits and features of the creatures you've encountered.#br#
 One day, once you become a master hunter,#br#
 this hunting notebook could be useful for instructing rookies.#char$$821$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Hmm, but is it even that useful?#br#
 Those notes are boring.#br#
 And there are already better books out there, I've seen them in the bookstore!#br#
 There's one that even shows you how to fight them! It's way better than this. Sorry, just saying!"#pets100+30$$2$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You're intrigued! You ask %p% more about the book,#br#
 hoping to get more useful information.#char$$823$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Take Armordillo for example. The books says, 'When Armordillo draws back its head, you have to stay #br#
 away from the beam coming out from its mouth. Otherwise you'll be caught in the beam#br#
 and incinerated.' Did you know that?"#pets100+30$$831$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 This book sounds awesome. You ask %p% if he has#br#
 any more factoids about Armordillo.#br#
 How to raise them, where to find one,#br#
 what they eat and where should they live.#char$$806$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Who cares about those things!#br#
 You're so lame, %n%.
 What are you, 85 years old? We only want to kill them to get the loot.#br#
 You're only interested in boring stuff. That's why nobody's gonna buy your book.#pets100+30$$821$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You keep pressing %p%for more info for dealing with Armordillo,#br#
 which have also seemed like a tricky opponent to take down in the wild.#char$$821$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Well, I'm afraid the author doesn't mention anything about that. He was eaten by a Quackadactyl.#br#
 The one who lives on our Ranch! The book was published posthumously.#br#
 Anyway, I always put the book down next to the Quackadactyl.#br#
 Maybe one day the soul of the author will come back via the Quackadactyl to finish the book." #M052010s40$Quackadactyl$4$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You still think your book idea is a good one.#br#
 Especially if it means you won't end up dying trying to finish writing it.#br#
 But you'll have to remember that tidbit about Armordillos!#char$$826$$0$0#|

"Hoho! You Scarlet Fangsaurs are gonna get it now!#br#
 How dare you bite me? You're gonna be in a world of hurt!#br#
 Taste the pain!",
 %p% screams loudly while leaning over the enclosure.#pets100+30$$824$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Hey, look! A special fragrant sachet from Lenora. How about that!"#br#
 You turn around to check the sachet in %p%'s hand.#br#
 Its familiar fragrance brings back memories...#char$$1$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You tell %p% to stop messing around,#br#
 and come help you prepare Scarlet Fangsaurs' food.#char$$821$$1$0#

"No! I've done a lot today already!#br#

"Hello,%n%. I've asked %p% to bring you some groceries.#br#
 We're all coming to dinner at your Ranch tonight! I hope that's okay!"#br#
 Lenora walks into your Ranch with a big smile. #M324090$Lenora$351$$0$0#

 You greet Lenora happily.#br#
 Suddenly you hear %p% yelp angrily.#char$$801$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Hey, give it back to me. You ugly creep! Give that back NOW!"#br#
 It seems like the sachet in %p%'s hand is causing quite the commotion among the Scarlet Fangsaurs.#br#
 One Fangsaur is even biting the sachet. #M001010$Scarlet Fangsaur$4$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You rush over to offer your assistance, but it's too late.#br#
 %p% loses their balance and falls inside the enclosure!#br#
 The fragrant powder inside the sachet has fallen out and gotten all over %p%.#br#
 It looks like it's driving the Scarlet Fangsaurs wild. #pets100+30$$825$$0$0#

#&7$Lenora##br#
"Oh no! I told %p% never to approach the Scarlet Fangsaurs with that sachet!#br#
 Oh, why didn't they listen!? What should we do now?"#br#
 Lenora rushes over to the enclosure anxiously. #M324090$Lenora$823$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You ask Lenora what exactly it is inside the sachet#br#
 that is driving the Fangsaurs so crazy.#char$$821$$0$0#

#&7$Lenora##br#
"Um... well. It's female Fangsaur pheromone.#br#
 It drives the males crazy.

 Wow. You don't know what to say. You look down at %p% and give them an encouraging little wave.

 %p% secretly creeps up towards the Arashi Ireclaw. #br#
 It looks like he wants to observe it from a closer vantage point.#pets100+30$$1$$0$0#

#&7$Arashi Ireclaw##br#
"Chirp...chirp...!"#br#
 Arashi Ireclaw picks up two huge rocks,#br#
 and starts to swing its claws rhythmically. #M026010s50$Arashi Ireclaw$101$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"What the...! I wasn't expecting that!"#br#
 %p% looks at the Ireclaw in shock.#pets100+30$$2$$0$0#

#&7$Arashi Ireclaw##br#
"Chirp...chirp...!!!!"#br#
 The Arashi Ireclaw is squawking in exertion as it #br#
 tries hard to lift itself, while still holding the giant rocks.
   #M026010s50$Arashi Ireclaw$501$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Oh, oh! Look at it go!
 The more %p% looks at it, the more surprised they get.#pets100+30$$1$$0$0#

#&7$Arashi Ireclaw##br#
"Chirp...!!!!"#br#
 Now the bird is struggling to lift a huge piece of split timber,#br#
 and raise it above its head. It's an impressive sight. #M026010s50$Arashi Ireclaw$601$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Unbelievable! Have you ever seen such a thing"#br#
 %p% is blown away.#pets100+30$$823$$0$0#

#&7$Arashi Ireclaw##br#
""Squaaaaaaaaawk...Ahh!!!!"#br#
 The Ireclaw puts the timber down,#br#
 and immediately starts to run around the Ranch. #M026010s50$Arashi Ireclaw$301$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Now I see. That's why they have such huge muscles!#br#
 They train all day with heavy rocks and logs! I wanna start working out too!#br# But I must get rid of my body hair first."
 %p% touches the tufted hair on their body.#pets100+30$$824$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You have your doubts, but %p% seems pretty set on their plan. #br# Good for them! But still, secretly, you hope they don't stick with it for long.#br#
 It might get a bit embarrassing if your Hoppalong can lift more than you!#char$$823$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"%n%, look! The Ireclaw is moving again!#br#
 Seems like it's rooting around for something in the hollow of that tree...?#pets100+30$$821$$0$0#

#&7$Arashi Ireclaw##br#
"Chirp...chirp...!!!!"#br#
 The bird takes out a heavy jar from the hole in the tree,#br#
 and slowly removes some white strips in the jar, which it proceeds to eat.#M026010s50$Arashi Ireclaw$503$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Oh no! Dried Hoppalong meat!? So that was the secret of its muscles!#br#

"Hey you! Tell me, what are you? A bear or a bulldog?"#br#
 %p% approaches the Grizzlejaw.#pets100+30$$831$$0$0#

#&7$Grizzlejaw##br#
 The Grizzlejaw clearly has no idea why %p% is asking it bizarre questions.#br#
 It gives %p%, a confused, pained look. #M106010s40+20$Grizzlejaw$1$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"When you sit, you look like a bear. But sometimes you act like a dog too...#br#
 Let's see..."#br#
 %p% excitedly looks for something in their bag.#pets100+30$$821$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
 %p% takes out some kind of fruit,#br#
 offering it to the Grizzlejaw to smell.#br#
"The way you smell it is definitely a bit doggy..."#M106010s40+20$Grizzlejaw$4$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Now... catch!"#br#
 %p% throws the fruit in the air for the Grizzlejaw to catch.#pets100+30$$831$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
 The Grizzlejaw stands up and catches the fruit on two feet like a bear.#br#
"Hmm... now you look more like a bear!"#M106010s40+20$Grizzlejaw$2011$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Okay...Let's see how you run then, shall we? Follow me!"#br#
 %p% starts to run and beckons to the Grizzlejaw to follow.#pets100+30$$303$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
 The Grizzlejaw starts to bound after %p%.#br#
"Well, I don't know what you look like when you run.#br#
 But since you do whatever I say... maybe you're more like a dog? Hehe!" #M106010s40+20$Grizzlejaw$301$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Suddenly, you see a figure at the side of the Ranch,#br#
 holding a steaming casserole...#char$$823$$0$0#

#&7$Omi##br#
"Hold up %p%!#br#
 Where are you rushing off to? Don't run here! It's dangerous!" #M803010s100+30$Omi$4$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Huh? Ahhh! Helllllllppppp! I can't stop!"
 %p% hasn't seen Omi standing in their path.#br#
 It's too late for them to alter their course! #pets100+30$$303$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
 At the last possible moment,#br#
 a huge creature appears from nowhere,#br#
 and pushes %p% aside.#br#
 It's saved %p%'s life! #M106010s40+20$Grizzlejaw$401$$0$0#

#&7$Grizzlejaw##br#
 It's the same Grizzlejaw that
 %p% was tormenting just moments earlier! #br#
 Wow.  It's not a bear or a bull dog.#br#
 It's a hero! #M106010s40+20$Grizzlejaw$2$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"You saved me... my hero!"#br#
 %p% falls to the ground,#br#
 prostrating themselves in a show of respect.#pets100+30$$504$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 But the beast is ignoring %p% completely. It has its head buried in the helpless Omi's pot! #br#
 Omi looks horrified, but there's nothing to be done. Bears will be bears!#char$$826$$1$0#|

 The Giantclaw Pangolin seems to have gone missing...#br#
 You look everywhere, but all you see are the pits it's always digging.
 Filling in all these Pangolin holes all the time really gets old fast!#char$$826$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"%n%, %n%, #br#
 we have pits all over the Ranch again...#br#
 Do we still have to fill them up? It's soooo tiring!"#pets100+30$$821$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You agree it's pretty pointless to keep filling in the holes when there are just #br#
 going to be more later. You need to get to the root of the problem.#char$$821$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Wait... You're not gonna send Pangie away, are you?"#pets100+30$$823$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 The Giantclaw Pangolin has been with you for decades.#br#
 You've been through a lot together in that time.#br#
 Although you don't know what the point of keeping it is, #br#
 You can't bear to see your pet leave.#char$$821$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"What if... How about we pave the Ranch in stone?#br#
 That would make it harder to dig up!"#pets100+30$$821$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 That might help...#br#
 But it seems like a lot of work.
 Aren't there any better solutions?#char$$823$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Okay, how about hiring someone to fill up the pits?"#pets100+30$$831$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Yes, but...
 That still wouldn't really fix the main problem.#br#
 Plus hiring someone costs money!#char$$826$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Okay... how about we move the Giantclaw Pangolin somewhere out in the middle of nowhere?#br#
 Then it can dig all the pits it wants#br#
 And we won't have to worry about fixing them."#pets100+30$$831$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 That sounds like a great plan ever.#br#
 You and %p% decide to move the Giantclaw Pangolin out to the middle of nowhere.#br#
 But first, you had better check in all the holes and find where it is digging now!

 its eyes clenched tightly in pain. #M030010s40$Ironfang Jackal$4$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Oh I was right!#br#
 It looks like this poor Jackal
 is suffering from tooth decay." #pets100+30$$831$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Decayed teeth? You'd assumed that Ironfang Jackals were immune to dental ailments. #br#
 After all, they are easily capable of chewing up iron with those giant fangs of theirs.#char$$823$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"But of course! Dental hygiene is extremely important! Even the strongest creatures#br#
 can get sick if they don't take proper care!#br#
 That means brushing AND flossing!"#pets100+30$$821$$0$0#

"Not only does your Ironfang Jackal here constantly chow down on hard to bite objects,#br#
 it also likes to stroll around in the middle of the night. It doesn't have regular sleeping hours."#pets100+30$$831$$0$0#

"It doesn't exercise, it doesn't eat properly,#br#
 it's really no surprise it's got as mouth full of rotten teeth as well!"#pets100+30$$831$$0$0#

"Why, yes... Of course! From now on...#br#
 You just have to take Jackie here out for a walk every day at the same time.#br#
 You have to change her diet too.#br#

 Ironfang Jackal howls at you.#br#
 It seems she agree with what %p% has prescribed. #M030010s40$Ironfang Jackal$2$$0$0#

 Do you have any idea why this Pterosaur might have lost its appetite?"#br#

#&7$Marvin##br#
"As a matter of fact, I do! Pterosaurs are extremely picky eaters.#br#
 The older they get, the more they want to eat, but the pickier they become.#br# They can be pretty demanding about the type of food you give them!#br#
 I knew of one that would only eat Kobe beef! #M812010s100+30$Marvin$831$$1$0#

"Hehe, you're asking the right person!#br#
 It just so happens, I've got loads of special fodder made especially for Crocamamie Pterosaurs, see?#br#
 I guarantee you, feed them my special dish and Terry here will be even more energetic than #br#

#&7$Crocamamie Pterosaur##br#
 While %p% is still deep in negotiation with Marvin,#br#
 The Pterosaur quietly sneaks up on the pair%p%,#br#
 slowly opens its mouth,#br#
 and moves to gobble them both up! #M005010s40$Crocamamie Pterosaur$2$$1$0#

#&7$Marvin##br#
"My goodness! Didn't you see? That creature almost ate us!#br#
 Now you see what I mean? If we don't feed it properly,#br#
 it'll keep trying to devour you. And next time you might not be as lucky, see?" #M812010s100+30$Marvin$831$$1$0#

#&7$Marvin##br#
"%n%, since you just saved my life,#br#
 I'd be prepared to give you a friendly discount on the food..."#br#
 Marvin flashes you that oily smile of his, and you know he's playing business.

#&7$%n%##br#
 You know better than to trust Marvin, but you're not quite sure what else to do.#br#

 Pets with two different kinds of attributes are the coolest.#br#

"Hang on! %n%, can't you see that it doesn't like that?"#pets100+30$$831$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 What is %p% talking about?#br#
 Silverspine Ringoon definitely likes what you're doing. Just look at it! It's such a lovely #br#
 bundle of fluff. And listen to it purr! It's in heaven.#br#
 %p% is talking slushbunkle again!#char$$821$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"No, I promise you. Listen closely. It's not a happy purr. That thing hates you! You should put it down right away before you get bit!"#br#
 %p% tells you off, eyes flashing angrily.#pets100+30$$831$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Imagine if you were a fluffy cute Dragomon,#br#
 and people kept picking you up just because you're cute.#br#
 How would you feel about it?"#pets100+30$$831$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Even when you're tired,#br#
 people keep bothering you and hugging you. #br#
 Even when you're trying to eat, or sleep! It must be annoying!#br#
 Don't you think?"#pets100+30$$831$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Imagine that! A life with no freedom!#br#
 Just because you look cute and fluffy.#br#
 It's not a blessing, it's a curse!#br#
 %n%, do me a favor—leave that poor Ringoon alone."#pets100+30$$831$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 After listening to %p%'s complaints,#br#
 you slowly release your arms from around the little creature.#br# 
 The Silverspine Ringoon continues its purring, only now you can tell#br#  
 that %p% was right. You must admit... the little fella sounds happier this way. #char$$806$$0$0#|

"%n%, can I ask you something? #br#
 It's something I've been wondering for a long time.
 Ever since I was little...#br#
 %p% looks up at a Faefly dancing in the sky.#pets100+30$$831$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You look up as well.#br#
 The Faefly looks so pretty, fluttering there. As its wings flap, shimmering, sweet smelling powder#br#
 drifts down, giving you a woozy, relaxed feeling. #br#
 You lightly scratch%p%'s head and ask what they are wondering.#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Alright...it's this.#br#
 That fluttering fairy up there, do you know where it gets its name? #br#
 Faefly... Such a pretty name. But I always thought they look more like flying ants.#br#
 Do you have any idea?"%p% asks you curiously.#pets100+30$$824$$1$0#

#&7$Faefly##br#
 You're taken aback by %p%'s question. You weren't expecting an etymological question.#br#
 The Faefly, meanwhile, seems to have overheard as well and is none too pleased by the ant comparison.#br#
 %p%, though, continues chatting, unaware of the Faefly, who has fluttered over#br#
 and is now glaring down at them, as if daring them to say one more word. #M123010s50-10$Faefly$302$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"The skin color looks painted-on.#br#
 The feathers on its head look like they were purchased at a dollar store.#br#
 The arms and legs are just weird marionette limbs.#br#
 It's like Frankenstein's monster. I don't get it.#pets100+30$$831$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Its legs are fat, its wings look like trash bags.#br#
 It fights with its belly... Who came up with this creature?#br#
 It's like an ugly, sad joke of an animal. What's it's deal?#pets100+30$$825$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You sit there, in shock, unsure what to say. Above you, the Faefly has heard everything. #br#
 You slowly gesture upwards to %p%, who is still unaware of the huge social faux-pas #br#
 they've just made. What are you to do? You have to say something.  #br#
 The Faefly seems like it's about to cry. How could %p%be so cruel?#char$$810$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You give %p% a disapproving look while you try and think of what#br#
 to say to cheer up the mournful looking Faefly.#br#
 You start to explain to %p% at length all about evolution and natural selection,#br#
 Darwin's Finches, and how adaptation works in the wild, and how the Faefly came to be.#char$$821$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"I still don't get it...#br#
 This is all too complicated. #br#
 I'm just a stupid bunny, how do you expect me to understand all that stuff about#br#
 finches and everlution?#pets100+30$$831$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You give %p% a tender pat on the head and continue giving examples of animal adaptation,#br#
 even explaining how Hoppalongs evolved from ancient Bunnysaurs over millions of years.#char$$806$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Ahhh!!"#br#
 %p% jumps up and screams.#br#
 Tears fill their eyes.#pets100+30$$823$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You didn't expect %p% to react so violently.#br#
 You apologize, but you're not sure what you did wrong this time.#br#
 You only wanted to help explain why Faeflies look the way they do...#char$$823$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Sob... It's okay, I get it...#br#
 I descended from an ugly brute.
 I'm sorry, Faefly. Now I know how you feel."#br#
 %p% hugs the Faefly and sobs repentantly.#pets100+30$$826$$1$0#

#&7$Faefly##br#
 The Faefly closes its eyes in response to %p%'s apology,#br#
 and sheds a large silent tear.#br#
 It hugs %p% tight, as both collapse into full scale bawling. #M123010s50-10$Faefly$601$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You have no idea what's going on with these two in front of you,#br#
 but you feel guilty anyhow. Maybe instead of a science lesson, you should have tried#br#
 a pizza party or something. Next time, you'll know better!#char$$810$$0$0#|
3505|#&7$%n%##br#
 You look lovingly at your Tinderhawk while you and %p% feed it.#br#
 You remember the days of when you first started raising it,#br#
 and how its mellowed down from the raging beast it once was.#br#
 You can't help but smile as you reach your hand out towards it.#char$$806$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"%n%, all the work it took to tame it has finally paid off.#br#
 I still have the scars from when it tried to rip my hands off!#br#
 You know, Omi probably could've used it as a star ingredient."#br#
 %p% says, half jokingly.#pets100+30$$831$$1$0#

#&7$Tinderhawk##br#
 The Tinderhawk, hearing what %p% just said, leans down#br#
 and affectionately nudges %p%'s face.#br#
 %p% looks a bit embarrassed as they let out a quiet giggle.   #M011010s75-180$Tinderhawk$4$$0$0#

#&7$Fate##br#
"Wh- where am I...?#br#
 Did I *hic* make a wrong turn..?#br#
 This map must be wrong!#br#
 Am I already in the Viridian Forest...?#M808010s100+30$Fate$301$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You two turn around to find Fate wandering around aimlessly, as usual.#br#
 You look at her and can't help but let out a loud laugh.#br#
 She's holding up the map to the light, but she's obviously staring at the blank side.#br#
 You and %p% thought you had seen it all when it came to Fate's sense of direction.#char$$826$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Hey Fate! You seem to know where you're going... Can I ask where to?"#br#
 %p% asks politely with a grin on their face.#pets100+30$$821$$0$0#

#&7$Fate##br#
"I'm going to... erm... um...#br#
 What was it again? *hic* Oh! Sporefall Core! Duh. Or wait..#br#
 Was it Sporefall Forest? Doesn't matter. I'm going to visit Garth.#br#
 I'm going to go pick up my customized airplane!" #M808010s100+30$Fate$831$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"A customized airplane? I've never heard of that... If it's what I imagine though, it sounds pretty cool!"#br#
 %p% asks with a quizzical look on their face.#pets100+30$$824$$0$0#

#&7$Fate##br#
"%p%, you think it's cool too?! Let me love you!"
 I figured that people might think that I was a little weird.#br#
 But, but Garth and I developed this plane on our own and, and...#br#
 It's just so awesome! It's like..."#br#
 Fate just kept going on and on. #M808010s100+30$Fate$822$$1$0#

#&7$Fate##br#
"Like really solidly built because of safety reasons and#br#
 we decided not to include a cockpit in it,#br#
 which means that there's no pilot! Do you know what that means?#br#
 No? It means that there's no one flying the plane, silly!#br#
 But, but even without a pilot, it flies straight and true!" #M808010s100+30$Fate$831$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Erm... that doesn't sound very safe to me.#br#
 And why isn't there an exhaust vent of some sort?#br#
 Won't it just overheat? I thought you had 'safety reasons' in mind."#br# 
 %p% starts to meticulously point out all of the structural deficiencies with Fate.#pets100+30$$831$$0$0#

#&7$Fate##br#
"Don't you worry about that! We've thought of everything!#br#
 We decided to put the engine right next to the body of the aircraft, which reflects heat.#br#
 We've also done away with any unnecessary plating to prevent overheating.#br#
 I can't wait to get it! It'll fly so fast that ever Dragomon won't be able to see it coming!" #M808010s100+30$Fate$821$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Oh, okay! I'm glad you thought of it!"#br#
 %p% replies cheerfully. You do notice a slight look of doubt on their face though.#pets100+30$$824$$0$0#

#&7$Fate##br#
"But wait! There's more!#br#
 It's got this super cool intelligent computer system that predicts Dragomon attacks.#br#
 If it senses an incoming attack of any kind, it'll automatically dodge it!#br#
 As long as the mainframe doesn't overheat, that is..."#M808010s100+30$Fate$831$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Oh wow! I think you've convinced me! I really want to see it in action!#br#
 Fate! Can I tag along?"#pets100+30$$821$$0$0#

#&7$Fate##br#
"Well, I don't see why not!  Hold on a minute..."#br#
 You notice a look of horror come across Fate's face as she rushes over to you. #M808010s100+30$Fate$823$$1$0#

#&7$Tinderhawk##br#
 Your Tinderhawk stares at Fate,#br#
 with an intense frown across its face.#br#
 It would seem that he's only willing to be friendly with you and %p%. #M011010s75-180$Tinderhawk$3$$0$0#

#&7$Fate##br#
"No... No... No... Th- *hic* this can't be!#br#
 The design for our plane hasn't been made public yet!#br#
 Someone must have gotten their thieving hands on the plans!"#br#
 Fate lets out a loud shriek. #M808010s100+30$Fate$825$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Fate, what are you talking about? What illegal copy?"#br#
 You and %p% both look around with a puzzled look.#pets100+30$$831$$0$0#

#&7$Fate##br#
"The copy of my customized airplane! DUH.#br#
 Just look at it! It's a blatant copy!#br#
 A pretty bad one at that. It's even made completely out of wood.#br#
 Though it does have a high-performance engine... It's a complete waste though! It's still a wooden aircraft!"#br#
 Fate looks your Tinderhawk up and down. #M808010s100+30$Fate$827$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Erm... Fate, I um, I think you're mistaken.#br#
 That's a Tinderhawk that %n% and I raised.#br#
 %p% replies.#pets100+30$$831$$0$0#

#&7$Fate##br#
"What? What are you talking about? I must go tell Garth immediately!#br#
 We have to hurry and apply for a patent before somebody beats us to it!! OW. That hurts!#br#
 How dare you? Who gave you the right? You... You pirated copy! UGH. Just...don't."
 The Tinderhawk won't stop pecking at Fate. #M808010s100+30$Fate$303$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Hey! Cut it out!!"#br#
 Fate takes off without saying goodbye, the Tinderhawk follows behind, in hot pursuit.#br#
 %p% also runs after the both of them.#br#
 You let out a loud sigh. Everything seems to have gotten completely out of hand.#pets100+30$$304$$0$0#|

"%n%, Primordiants are the best,#br#
 Aren't they?"#br#
 %p% asks you while riding atop of a Primordiant.#pets100+30$$824$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You look up at %p%,#br#
 and you remember that they used to be terrified of them.%p%
 Puzzles, you look at him and wonder how this quick change of disposition came about,#br# 
 and how they've managed to get so close to on another.#char$$821$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"I know that we didn't used to get along but,#br#
 we were all out of fodder a while ago,#br#
 and I was forced to ride a Primordiant all the way to Elysium just to get more."#br#
 %p% starts to recount the story of their fateful ride.#pets100+30$$831$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"I was so exhausted that I didn't even care about who I went with,#br#
 and I maybe - just a teenie, tiny bit - might have fallen asleep,#br#
 so I just happened to miss some traffic lights."#pets100+30$$831$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 A cold shiver rushes down your spine as you hear this.#br#
 If hit by a hunter who was riding a mount like Apollo,#br#
 well- well there's no telling what might happen.#br#
 Tentatively, you ask %p% to continue retelling the terrible story.#char$$823$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Hehehe... I mean, I know it was a dangerous situation and all,#br#
 and I'll totally pay more attention next time, but the point is that#br#
 I discovered that Primordiants are actually completely colorblind!#br#
 We flew through every single traffic light because it couldn't tell if it was green or red!"#pets100+30$$821$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You stare at %p% in completely disbelief.#br#
 A sleeping driver on a colorblind mount?#br#
 It sounds like the butt of the worst joke imagineable!#br#
 But, if you remember correctly, %p% did manage to come back with some feed that day. #br#
 Someone must be looking out for them.#char$$825$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"If it weren't for this Primordiant, who knows what might have happened to me!#br#
 What makes it even better is that he was super hungry that day,#br#
 and it took him half the amount of time to get there.#br#
 Although, he may or may not have drooled on me a bit."#pets100+30$$831$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You shudder at the thought of a Primordiant drooling acidic mucus all the way through Elysium.#br#
 The cost of the damage must be incalculable!#br#
 They might even seek compensation for this salival matter.#br#
 You can feel the migraine starting to pound.#char$$826$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
Relax, %n%!#br#
 You know that I always wear my riding helmet when I go out!#br#
 I appreciate you worrying about my safety though! You're too kind."#br#
 %p% feels so blessed by your concern.#pets100+30$$822$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Hearing this, you instantly feel relieved, maybe not so much about the safety aspect,#br#
 but with a helmet covering their face, no one would've been able to recognize %p%.#br#
 Your constant pestering for them to wear a helmet maybe have saved you millions in compensation!#char$$809$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"After I got back, I was so amazed by the Primordiant's speed,#br#
 that I got to thinking and decided to do some research on Shellomon mounts.#br#
 I discovered that Primordiants are three times faster than most other Dragomon because of their color and horns."#br#
 %p% says excitedly.#pets100+30$$824$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 The odd fact has you wondering about whether %p% read about mount speed or breeding habits,#br#
 but you're in no mood to engage them in a scholarly debate,#br#
 so you let the conversation die out.#br#
 You're just glad that they didn't get noticed and that they got back safely, that's all.#char$$806$$0$0#|

"Don't you get it, Sharpfang Mole?#br#
 This food is a precious commodity.#br#
 You've gotta eat it! If not, there might not be any more food tomorrow."#br#
 %p% angrily yells at the Sharpfang Mole.#pets100+30$$831$$1$0#

#&7$Sharpfang Mole##br#
 The Sharpfang Mole cowers into a corner and looks really upset#br#
 upon hearing %p% verbally berate it for not eating.#br#
 As the Sharpfang Mole backs up, your surprised to see that its incisors have grown so large that they touch the ground.#br#
 It's gotten so bad that it can't even crouch down properly. #M100010s25+70$Sharpfang Mole$501$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You rack your brain, trying to figure out why#br#
 the Sharpfang Mole would pass on finishing delicious food.#br#
 Eager to figure out this puzzle, you ask %p% how they feed the Sharpfang Mole.#br#
 %p% then shows you a big bowl that you hadn't noticed before.#char$$821$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"This is the bowl that I used to feed them.#br#
 I've always heard that Sharpfang Moles are supposed to be a clever bunch,#br#
 so I figured they'd manage but I guess they aren't that clever after all.#br#
 It's also easier for me to clear up after they've eaten."#pets100+30$$821$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You're surprised that the Sharpfang Mole didn't react to %p%'s comment,#br#
 but you take the bowl and put it in front of its face.#br#
 The Sharpfang Mole seems to understand what you want as it lifts its head,#br#
 and moves towards the bowl in your outstretched hands.#char$$803$$1$0#

#&7$Sharpfang Mole##br#
 The Sharpfang Mole leans in, and tries to put its mouth into the bowl,#br#
 but, as you expected,#br#
 its incisors hit the bottom of the bowl before the rest of its mouth gets anywhere near it.#br#
 The Sharpfang Mole lets out a defeated sigh and shuts its mouth again. #M100010s25+70$Sharpfang Mole$503$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Well I'll be. I had no clue that they couldn't reach the food.#br#
 Ugh, I feel like a complete fool!#br#
 I should've realized it but I completely overlooked it."#br#
 %p% looks embarrassed and obviously feels bad about the situation.#pets100+30$$827$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Trying to lighten the mood, you tell %p% and the Sharpfang Mole,#br#
 that you'll try to figure out a better way of feeding them.#br#
 The Sharpfang Mole nods unconcernedly,#br#
 and oddly seems to be completely uninterested in finding a solution.#char$$807$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Oh, I just remembered! I still have quality meat left over.#br#
 %n%, do you think I could use it to feed the Sharpfang Mole since I don't need it and#br#
 to make up for my stupidity?"#br#
 %p% asks you with big puppy eyes.#pets100+30$$824$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You notice that the Sharpfang Mole suddenly perks up at %p%'s proposal,#br#
 so you decide to agree with %p%'s request.#br#
 %p% hurriedly rushes over to where they're keeping the extra meat.#char$$806$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
 %p% rushes back with the meat in their hands,#br#
 but they stumble as they get closer and the meat goes flying into the air.#br#
 By some sort sheer coincidence, the meat comes tumbling down and lands safely in the bowl.#br#
 %p% lays on the ground, their face red with shame.#pets100+30$$823$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Eek! I'm sooooo sorry! Almost did it again.#br#
 Sharpfang Mole you just wait right there and,#br#
 I'll take the meat out of the bowl so that you can eat it. Just hold on."#pets100+30$$821$$1$0#

#&7$Sharpfang Mole##br#
 Not paying any attention to you or %p% at all, the Sharpfang Mole,#br#
 goes over to the bowl, reaches in with its paw, and snatches the meat out.#br#
 It take the meat and drops it into its mouth with one big bite.#br#
 You stare for a moment in shock, and then you realize that its played you two like a fiddle. #M100010s25+50$Sharpfang Mole$2011$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
" Well, well, well...#br#
 I guess we didn't give the Sharpfang Mole enough credit.#br#
 Too bad it outsmarted itself, hehe."#br#
 %p% has a coy smile come across their face.#pets100+30$$825$$1$0#

#&7$Sharpfang Mole##br#
 At that moment, the Sharpfang Mole realizes that the jig is up,#br#
 and it tries to go back to being a poor old, underfed little Dragomon,#br#
 but you and %p% know better. #M100010s25+70$Sharpfang Mole$4$$0$0#

"I pity the fool who falls for your charades! Trying to pull a fast one on us, huh?#br#
 I'll have to make sure to pick up Omi's weekly menu,#br#
 and you can be his number one customer!"#br#
 %p% says angrily and they turn and leave.#pets100+30$$827$$1$0#

#&7$Sharpfang Mole##br#
 The Sharpfang Mole looks at you as if seeking someone to side with them but,#br#
 you just shrug.#br#
 Maybe Omi's weekly menu won't be that bad, or better yet, the Sharpfang Mole will learn its lesson.#br#
 You doubt it, though. #M100010s25+70$Sharpfang Mole$501$$0$0#|

 Ha- have you seen Ice Wolfie?#br#
 I've been to every corner of the ranch and I just can't find him."#br#

 Taking into account %p%'s complete panic,#br#

 you immediately ask him what in tarnation is going on around here.#char$$821$$0$0#

"I'm obviously talking about Ice Wolfie! That wound he's got is infected!#br#
 I went and chewed up some of these red herbs I've been reading about#br#
 so that I can treat the wounds but now it's gone. GONE!"
 %p% finally notices the mess around its mouth and tries to wipe it, spreading it all over its face.#pets100+30$$824$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 After hearing %p%'s story about Ice Wolfie. you suddenly realize that he means the Boreasaur.
 You have no idea what makes %p% call it Ice Wolfie#br#
 but in the end, it doesn't really matter. They've come so far together.#br#
 You look at %p% and tell them that you haven't seen the Boreasaur around.#char$$807$$0$0#

"That's really strange...  Our Ranch isn't that big, and I swear I've looked everywhere.#br#
 There's no way it can just completely disappear!"#br#
 %p% with complete panic in their eyes.#pets100+30$$3$$1$0#

#&7$Lenora##br#
"Hello, %n% and %p%!#br#
 I just wanted to see if you need anymore of those herbs I gave you since I've got some left.#br#
 You seem like you're having some trouble, though..."#br#

 %p% runs over to Lenora and clings to her leg.#pets100+30$$823$$1$0#

#&7$Lenora##br#
 Lenora looks down at %p% who's seemingly got blood pouring out of their mouth.#br#
 She then looks up at you and you notice the confusion in her eyes.#br#
 You decide to explain the entire story to her. #M324090$Lenora$826$$0$0#

#&7$Lenora##br#
"Right, well, I can handle this. Easy peasy. I just need something that the Boreasaur has touched,#br#

 Do you think you can use these?"#pets100+30$$831$$1$0#

"They're perfect! Give me just a second."#br#

 Suddenly, she sits up and starts to cast a spell with her staff. #M324090$Lenora$601$$0$0#

#&7$Lenora##br#
 Lenora slowly lowers her staff and#br#
 she looks over at you and %p% with a sad look.
 Without saying a word, she then lowers her gaze to the ground.  #M324090$Lenora$3$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"So did you manage to track down Ice Wolfie, Lenora?"#br#
 %p% says worriedly.#pets100+30$$831$$1$0#

#&7$Lenora##br#
"Your Boreasaur... Ice Wolfie..."#br#
 Lenora's eyes glaze over and she begins to shake her head.#br#
"Ice Wolfie wasn't able to handle the hot weather that we have,#br#
 and he... he melted!"#M324090$Lenora$827$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"No... NO! That can't be!"#br#
 %p% screamed with tears in their eyes.#br#
"Why?! After all of these years we've spent together...#br#
 I can't imagine life without Ice Wolfie anymore! This can't be happening."#pets100+30$$827$$1$0#

#&7$Lenora##br#
"You're right. He didn't melt at all!  I was just making a little joke!"#br#
 Lenora giggles and points behind %p%.#br#
"You've actually nursed Ice Wolfie back to health and you didn't even know it!#br#
 It was just playing hide and seek, but it must've failed to let you know." #M324090$Lenora$824$$0$0#

#&7$Boreasaur##br#
 The Boreasaur gleefully jumps over to %p% and starts licking their face.#br#
 %p% just stands there in complete shock.#br#
 "I- uh. Huh? Um. Heh"#br#
 They can't seem to form meaningful words as they stare blankly. #M002010s50$Boreasaur$351$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You are shocked that even someone so serious and caring like Lenora could make jokes.#br#
 This is most unusual#br#
 You ask her what the deal was, but she only replies with a slight smile.#char$$821$$1$0#

#&7$Lenora##br#
"Nash is always making fun of me and I never understood what the point was.#br#
 I decided to try it out just to see what would happen,#br#
 and that's when I realized just how much fun it was!#br#
 I apologize if I've hurt your feelings, but I'm new at this."#br#
 Lenora bows to you out of respect. #M324090$Lenora$822$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Ah, so Lenora learned this from Nash's constant teasing.#br#
 As someone who takes care of and heals people,#br#
 she might be putting people's health at risk if she continually jokes with them.#br#
 You decide to have a talk with Agatha so that she can decide what to do about Nash.#char$$806$$1$0#|

"YAWWWWWWWWWWWWWWN!"#br#
 %p% yawns loudly, almost as if hoping to get noticed as he#br#
 lies by the side of a Nautilubus's shell,#br#
 with a smug look across his face.#pets100+30$$2$$1$0#

#&7$Omi##br#
"%p%, are you always so lazy?#br#
 I've never seen another Hoppalong quite like you#br#
 How can you spend such productive hours of the day just laying around?"#br#
 Omi shakes his head then passes you an Invoice. #M803010s100+30$Omi$831$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Hey! I resent that. I like the way I am!"#br#
 %p% looks over at the Nautilubus, who has disappeared into its shell, and taps at it.
"Our little Nautilubus is also just hanging out with me.#br#
 We're just chillin' out, maxin', and relaxin'!"#pets100+30$$821$$1$0#

#&7$Omi##br#
"Why are you behaving like your own little pet?#br#
 That just can't possibly be normal..."#br#
 Omi turns back to you, takes back the signed Invoice and says,#br#
"Which reminds me, how big are the claws of your little Nautilubus?" #M803010s100+30$Omi$831$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Why does that even matter?#br#
 He's not planning on taking part in any battles or sort of violence."#br#
 Omi just kinda stares at %p% and finally looks over to you.#br#
 Confused by the line of questioning, you simply shrug and reply that they've never been measured before.#pets100+30$$2$$1$0#

#&7$Omi##br#
"What? Don't look at me like I'm the weird one. Owners of Nautilubus often exaggerate how big their claws are.#br#
 You guys are the weird ones.#br#
 So I take it you have no idea then. Maybe this big?"#br#
 Omi draws a large circle in the air. #M803010s100+30$Omi$824$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"I dunno... I haven't even seen our little Nautilubus for a while actually.#br#
 It's always sleeping, so I figured I'd join in."#br#
 %p% stretches their arms out and then lies down comfortably.#pets100+30$$2$$1$0#

#&7$Omi##br#
"You sure are something else. Unbelievable!#br#
 What if the shell is empty? What then, %p%?#br#
 I bet you wouldn't even notice if that were the case."#br#
 Omi says in complete disbelief. #M803010s100+30$Omi$827$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"I don't know what you're getting at, Omi. This isn't some big spooky, haunted ranch.#br#
 My little Nautilubus friend here eats its food every day,
 and the shell is most definitely not empty!"#br#
 %p% replies as convincingly as possible.#br#
"Though, it's been a while since I've seen him. I just know that he eats everything!"#pets100+30$$831$$1$0#

#&7$Nautilubus##br#
 After listening to their argument, you suddenly feel as if something huge is approaching you from the side.#br#
 You turn around slowly to see a gigantic Nautilubus peering over your shoulder.#br#
 You slowly come to the realization that it's the little Nautilubus that you used to know. #M017010s40+50$Nautilubus$351$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
 %p% is in complete shock.#br#
 They rush over to your leg, and point at the shell, their fingering shaking violently.#br#
"If... If you're my little Nautilubus, then what's inside the shell..."#pets100+30$$823$$1$0#

#&7$Omi##br#
"Ha! I knew it!#br#
 So that's the shell that your Nautilubus shed when it got too big."#br#
 Omi walks over to the shell. #M803010s100+30$Omi$301$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Omi! Don't do it!#br#
 The shell isn't empty!#br#
 I'm sure it's filled with all kinds of creepy crawlies!"#br#
 %p% screams in horror at the thought of what they had been sleeping next to.#pets100+30$$827$$1$0#

#&7$Omi##br#
"What's this? A peasant come to show me another oh-so-valuable relic, I'm sure.#br# What are you so afraid of, %p%?#br#
 Weren't you the one that said the ranch wasn't haunted?#br#
 You don't even have to look, but I will."#br#
 Omi slowly lifts up the shell, almost as if to purposely add suspense to the moment. #M803010s100+30$Omi$8831$$0$0#

#&7$Omi##br#
"Whooooa! Bleeeeeeech! Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!"#br#
 Omi lets out a series of terrifying wails,#br#
 jumps onto the gearcopter,#br#
 and takes off without another word. #M803010s100+30$Omi$303$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"So, uh... what was inside the shell?"#br#
 %p% collapses on the sand#br#
 and begins mumbling to themselves.#pets100+30$$501$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Normally you'd jump at the chance to make some awful jokes about what could#br#
 be hidden in the shell to %p%, but you decide that the timing might be a little#br#
 inappropriate. Although you're slightly curious about what scared Omi off so quickly,#br#
 you look over at the harmless Nautilubus and decide that it's not worth the effort.

 You nod to %p%.#br#
 You wonder exactly how they managed to upgrade the vambraces.#char$$806$$0$0#

"Watch out!"#br#
 %p% yells out loud, startling you slightly, and#br#
 suddenly, a knife pops out from within the vambrace.#pets100+30$$2011$$1$0#

#&7$Marvin##br#
"That's pretty lame.#br#
 And no, I highly doubt anyone would spend anything on this."#br#
 Marvin says as he puts the ranch tools that you ordered aside. #M812010s100+30$Marvin$831$$0$0#

"What?! Why are you even here? Are you just here to argue, Marvin?#br#
 What's wrong with my vambrace? It's the best! You got a problem?"#br#
 %p% angrily implores.#pets100+30$$825$$1$0#

#&7$Marvin##br#
"I most definitely have a problem with your so-called masterpiece.#br#
 Here's a question for you. Is this a weapon or a piece of armor?"#br#
 Marvin asks seriously. #M812010s100+30$Marvin$831$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Well it's obviously a piece of armor. Duh!#br#
 Are you blind, or what?"#br#
 %p% retorts.#pets100+30$$831$$1$0#

#&7$Marvin##br#
"Well, if that's the case,#br#
 If you throw in a blade, then it's much too heavy to be used as armor.#br#
 Who would ever want to buy that?" #M812010s100+30$Marvin$831$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Fine then... It's actually a weapon!#br#
 A very lethal weapon at that.#br#
 Look at how sharp and deadly it is!"#br#
 %p% stutters as they try to make their case.#pets100+30$$3$$1$0#

#&7$Marvin##br#
"Oh ho, so now it's a weapon, huh?#br#
 You've really gotta be kidding me now.#br#
 The blade is shorter than my... kitchen knife. You'll be killed,#br#
 before you can even get to your enemy." #M812010s100+30$Marvin$831$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Psh! It's not as bad as you think it is!#br#
 I was smart enough to model it off the Dracopard's forewing!#br#
 The Dracopard is famous for it's attacking prowess, and now my vambrace has adopted its strengths!"#br#
 %p% says defiantly, almost as if trying to will his masterpiece into Marvin's heart.#pets100+30$$825$$1$0#

#&7$Marvin##br#
"Do you even know how the Dracopard attacks?"#br#
 Marvin asks, his face remaining emotionless. #M812010s100+30$Marvin$831$$0$0#

"Err... umm... with their talons, of course!"#br#
 %p% replies diffidently.#pets100+30$$1$$1$0#

#&7$Marvin##br#
"Have you ever even seen the Dracopard flying with its forewings before?#br#
 Or maybe even gliding? Huh? Have ya?"#br#
 Marvin asks further. #M812010s100+30$Marvin$831$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Uhhh... I guess not."#br#
 %p% looks down sheepishly.#pets100+30$$826$$1$0#

#&7$Marvin##br#
"Well there you have it. It's not very convincing as a weapon or even a piece of armor.#br#
 Nobody is going to buy it.#br#
 Got it?"#br#
 Marvin says emphatically. #M812010s100+30$Marvin$831$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"I got it..."#br#

"Wait a minute... Didn't you just say that..."#br#
 %p% looks at Marvin suspiciously.#pets100+30$$823$$1$0#

#&7$Marvin##br#
"That's right
 It's the newest trend! More and more people are fascinated by winged flightless creatures!#br#
 I'm making some clothes for my doll and it might look cooler with your vambrace.#br#
 Someone in the theme park is bound to pay a hefty price for it. Don't you agree?"#br#
 Marvin says cheerfully. #M812010s100+30$Marvin$822$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Oh. Well it's not for sale!"#br#

"Hey! %p%, come on!#br#
 Can we at least talk about it?"#br#
 Marvin takes off in their direction. #M812010s100+30$Marvin$303$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Ermm... well... I just wanted to see what it was like to ride on the Chillizard.#br#
 Almost every other hunter I've seen riding one in Elysium is only wearing underpants.#br#
 I have no clue how they manage it since they've got such a spiky back...#br#
 I thought I should wear some protection."#pets100+30$$831$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
 %p% cautiously climbs up onto the Chillizard.#br#
 Even with all of the clothing, he can't avoid being spiked again.#br#
 After some time, he manages to properly get seated,#br#

 How come you can just jump on it and not get spiked?#br#
 HOW?"#br#

#&7$Enkidu##br#
"%p%, you really must refrain from the complaints. You're giving us a bad reputation.#br#
 You should just be thankful of what you already possess."#br#
 Enkidu appears out of nowhere.

"Ah! Enkidu!#br#
 But... Don't you think it's a bit odd?#br#

 %p% complains loudly.#pets100+30$$827$$1$0#

#&7$Enkidu##br#
"Ha! Watch carefully."#br#
 All of a sudden, Enkidu lets out a terrific yell.#br#
"Chillizard! Wild Assault!" #M813010s100+30$Enkidu$2011$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You instantly feel the Chillizard move.#br#
 But before there's even time to react,#br#
 you're launched flying off of its back.#char$$505$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 With your back in the dirt, you're surprised that the Chillizard actually listened to Enkidu.#br#
 Enkidu and %p%, both of whom were within attacking range, are completely uninjured.#br#
 %p% looks at you in a state of shock.#br#
 Enkidu walks over to you and helps you up.#char$$702$$1$0#

#&7$Enkidu##br#
"Sorry about that, %n%.#br#
 This was the only way to make your partner over there shut up.#br# 
 You weren't hurt too bad, where you?"#br#
 Enkidu brushes the dirt off of your shoulder. #M813010s100+30$Enkidu$831$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Come to think of it, the last time you went hunting for Dragomon,#br#
 you were also the only one being swept aside by them,#br#
 while %p% didn't have a scratch on them.#br#
 Curious, you ask Enkidu what the deal is.#char$$821$$1$0#

"What's wrong with you two?#br#

 You two can figure it out yourselves."#br#

 Once Enkidu is gone, you and %p% look at each other more confused than ever.#br#

 Still, you have no answer.#pets100+30$$1$$0$0#|

"Hi %n% and %p%!#br#
 It's been forever and a day since I've seen you two! I wasn't away that you guys lived here!"#br#

 Enkidu pats %p%'s head.#br# 
"There's no need to be sad. Look on the bright side of things. Yours is a descendant of a king of the Sharkicane!#br#
 If you train it well enough, it can become a king as well!" #M813010s100+30$Enkidu$831$$1$0#

"Okay, okay! It seems as if this visit is over.#br#

"I have no idea why the Icecrystal Snapper wanted that coin so badly either.#br#
 I mean, I guess all of the requests require coins but,#br#
 I've already given out too many... sob sob..."#pets100+30$$827$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 It's news to you that we had an Icecrystal Snapper who loves money so much!#br#
 It's no wonder that %p% has been always asking for food as of late. It makes sense now!#char$$823$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
 %p% continue moaning about their lost money.#br#
"You know what? Whatever!#br#
 It's in the past. I don't care anymore.#br#
 Let's BBQ!"#pets100+30$$831$$0$0#|

 Looking at the Abyssal Crab makes you realize just how much it has grown.#br#
 You and %p% feel like emotionally proud parents. #M018010s35+10$Abyssal Crab$1$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You ask %p% if they remember#br#
 about the very first Dragomon that you hunted together.#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Yeah! Of course I remember!#br# 
 It was an Abyssal Crab with a huge shell and two gigantic pincers!"#pets100+30$$821$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You look back fondly on the day you rolled on the ground,#br#
 in order to dodge its twirl attack...#char$$826$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Oh yeah! And I headed straight into its whirlwind, right?#br#
 %n%, weren't you completely shocked when I did that?"#br#
 %p% asks you fondly.#pets100+30$$831$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You nod and claim that you weren't expecting,#br#
 that the powerful Abyssal Crab that you fought that day,#br#
 would end up so sweet and tame on the Ranch.#char$$821$$0$0#

#&7$Abyssal Crab##br#
 Suddenly, the Abyssal Crab reacts and starts to gesture with its huge pincers.#br#
 It looks to you with a respectful look and seems to want to say something. #M018010s35+10$Abyssal Crab$102$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"%n%! %n%! Stand back!#br#
 The Abyssal Crab is ready to attack!"#pets100+30$$823$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You smile, pat %p%'s head,#br#
 and tell him that the Abyssal Crab just wants to show off how much it's grown.#br#
 You sit back and await the show.#char$$4$$1$0#

#&7$Abyssal Crab##br#
 The Abyssal Crab starts to swirl, almost uncontrollably.#br#
 Even though the fierce wind that's created rushes towards you,#br#
 you remain perfectly still. #M018010s35+10$Abyssal Crab$30006$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Aww, look at that! Not only has our little Abyssal Crab grown up but,#br#
 %n% is now a fearless hunter!"#pets100+30$$822$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Without saying a word, you simply smile at %p%.#br#
 You still feel as if there's something missing...#char$$4$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"%n%... Is something bothering you...?"#br#
 %p% looks at you worriedly.#pets100+30$$831$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You shake your head but don't answer %p%.#br#
 You let out a deep sigh and leave the Ranch.#char$$821$$1$0#|
3515|#&7$%n%##br#
 You and %p% both return to the Ranch.#br#
 Suddenly, and limping Carapaced Colossus approaches out of nowhere.#char$$2$$0$0#

#&7$Carapaced Colossus##br#
"Hiss...hiss..."#br#
 The Carapaced Colossus just look completely dejected. #M040010s40+20$Carapaced Colossus$302$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Hey %n%, check to see if there's something wrong with the Carapaced Colossus."#br#
 %p% gives the Carapaced Colossus a once-over and notices something strange.#pets100+30$$823$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Its entire hind leg is missing!#char$$823$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"We didn't do this, did we?#br#
 If we did, it could've happened when we captured it and we just didn't notice."#br#
 %p% looks at you horrified.#pets100+30$$827$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You remember that the last time you went hunting after this particular Carapaced Colossus,#br#
 it went rampaging through the marsh.#char$$4$$1$0#

#&7$Carapaced Colossus##br#
"Hiss...hiss...hiss...!"#br#
 The Carapaced Colossus continues to hiss even more forcefully. #M040010s40+20$Carapaced Colossus$102$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"It's definitely grumbling at us...#br#
 If we had been more careful, it wouldn't have turned out like this..."#br#
 %p% is obviously ashamed and dares not look in the Carapaced Colossus' direction.#pets100+30$$826$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You pat %p%'s head regrettably,#br#
 and tell them that whether this was your fault or not,#br#
 it was something that you just couldn't foresee.#char$$821$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You tell %p% that the Carapaced Colossus was fortunate that we're the ones to have caught it.#br#
 If it were other hunters, it would've surely been torn to pieces.#char$$4$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"I guess so...#br#
 but I just feel so bad for what happened and..."#pets100+30$$831$$0$0#

#&7$Carapaced Colossus##br#
"Hiss...hissss...!"#br#
 Before %p% gets a chance to finish their sentence, the Carapaced Colossus suddenly raises its head,#br#
 and hisses loudly.#br#
 It seems to be very angry and unforgiving. #M040010s40+20$Carapaced Colossus$501$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You tell%p%,#br#
 that the world is really a complicated place,#br#
 and that you can't feel sorry for every creature that you capture, even the Carapaced Colossus.#br#
 Hunters should be merciless when hunting.#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"I guess you're right..."#pets100+30$$1$$1$0#|
3516|#&7$Michaela##br#
"Help me! HEEEEEEEELP ME! Get this two-ton, red monstrosity AWAY from me!"
 #M807010s100+30$Marcy$304$$0$0#

#&7$Crimson Claw##br#
"Guurrrraaaoar!!" #M003010s50+10$Crimson Claw$302$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You and %p% have just arrived back at your ranch—all set for a day of organic#br#
 fun in the sun—when you spot your very own Crimson Claw on the hunt.#br#Unfortunately, its current prey appears to be none other than a Hoppalong you're#br#MORE than familiar with...#char$$823$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"What's going on here? Isn't that Michaela? What's SHE doing here?#br#
 Michaela! Michaaaaaeeeelaaaa! Stop playing with our Crimson Claw#br#
 and come talk to us like a decent rabbit for once."#pets100+30$$831$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You refrain from commenting that if this is Michaela's version of "playing,"#br#
 she must have had incredibly cruel parents.#char$$826$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"At any rate, she's gonna totally tucker him out! Poor guy won't leave#br# the stables for a week! C'mon, %n%! Let's go put a stop to this Jurassic joviality!"
 #pets100+30$$823$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Though your reasoning differs slightly from %p%'s, you agree that#br#something needs to be done, and the two of you rush forward to do just that.#char$$1$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Just as the two of you approach, however, your charge is interrupted by a#br#
 bodiless voice from above. For just a second, you wonder if—perchance—your#br#
 your Crimson Claw has somehow gained the ability of speech, but your#br#thoughts are cut short when an all-too-familiar form descends from the sky.#char$$2$$0$0#

#&7$Nash##br#
"Never fear, my good lady! Your assiduous, glamorous, and altogether awe-inspiring#br#
 companion, Nash the dragonmeister, is here to put a stop to this red-clawed fiend!"
   #M322090$Nash$301$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Thunder and lightning streak the sky with an earth-shattering boom as Nash#br#
 pounces from who-knows-where to perch atop your Crimson Claw's head like#br#
 some kind of blue-feathered avian.#char$$823$$0$0#

#&7$Nash##br#
"You unsightly hound! How dare you attack a lady! Shall I demonstrate#br#
 what happens when you incur the rage of a Wyverian dragonmeister?"
   #M322090$Nash$30001$$1$0#

#&7$Nash##br#
 Before he can so much as finish his sentence, Nash splays a hand out, and you'll admit#br#
 you find yourself entranced as a swirling, tumultuous ball of flame builds in the center of
 his palm. All of a sudden, he takes a hold of his staff with both hands, the turbid#br#energy transferring to the long stave and causing it to glow with an unearthly light. #M322090$Nash$601$$1$0#

#&7$Nash##br#
"Michaela, I've thought up the most PERFECT name for my newest spell! You're sure#br#
 to take a liking to it, I'd imagine. 'Celestial Inferno of Dragon Devastation!' Catchy,#br#isn't it? Sure to turn a few heads when I whip it out. And then, of course, I'll impress them#br#further with the sheer destructive capabilities of the spell itself." #M322090$Nash$4$$1$0#

#&7$Michaela##br#
"That 'Celestial Inferno' must be referring to the hot air you're spewing right now, young#br#
 man, because it AIN'T HELPIN' ME. Now GET this mutated, crust-infested freak OFF#br#
 of me! Lenora's not here, so you've got no one to impress, you denial-ridden pretty boy!"#br#
 You're almost amazed at the retorts Michaela can spew whilst running for her life. #M807010s100+30$Michaela$304$$0$0#

#&7$Nash##br#
"Lenora?! What does Lenora have to do with any of this, you rabbit witch? And#br#
 what's all this about denial? The only denial I'm currently affronted with is my#br#increasing infuriation while dealing with YOU!" #M322090$Nash$821$$1$0#

#&7$Michaela##br#
"Oh, SHOVE IT, dandy spandy! You need me and you know it! Even if you don't realize#br#
 it until after this crustoid cretin from the black lagoon has eaten me WHOLE! Now, are#br#
 you gonna stand there and spew baloney as laughable as your fragile masculinity#br#
 or are you gonna SAVE ME?!?" Michaela narrowly avoids a subsequent chomp. #M807010s100+30$Michaela$825$$0$0#

#&7$Nash##br#
"You... you heathenish wench! As if I would so much as lift a finger to help you NOW!#br#
 I can see when I'm not appreciated! And I can return the favor in kind! Good DAY#br#
 to you, ma'am! And may you rot in the bowels of this infernal creature for all I care!" #M322090$Nash$826$$1$0#

#&7$Michaela##br#
"You biiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii..."#br#
 Michaela's voice fades in the breeze as your Crimson Claw chases#br#her out of earshot. #M807010s100+30$Michaela$303$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Meanwhile, you and %p% simply stare after the retreating forms of the hapless#br#
 duo and your chomp-happy Crimson Claw, neither one of you quite sure what to do#br#given the circumstances.#char$$2$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"What, uh... what do you think we should do, %n%?"#br#
 %p% turns towards you, one eyebrow raised in inquiry.#pets100+30$$826$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You sigh—somewhat defeated—and respond that you simply hope you still have#br#a Crimson Claw on your ranch this time tomorrow.#char$$826$$0$0#|
3517|#&7$%p%##br#
"Hey! Isn't that Lenora over there? It IS Lenora! C'mon, %n%, let's go see what#br# she wants!" Your excitable companion perks up the moment you lay eyes on the two#br# sudden visitors to your ranch, and you follow behind them as they scurry over to#br#
 say hello. "Hey, Lenora! Hey! What're you doing here, huh? And why'd you bring Nash?!"
   #pets100+30$$821$$0$0#

#&7$Lenora##br#
 Lenora turns around upon your approach, but remains silent.#br#
 Something about her expression keys you into the fact that she's#br#not exactly pleased at your arrival. #M324090$Lenora$823$$1$0#

#&7$Nash##br#
"Welcome, friends! Ladies and gentlemen! Compatriots of all ages! I am here to present#br# unto you—with humblest of hearts—my brand new, awe-inspiring, breath-eliminating#br#
 'Celestial Inferno of Dragon Devastation' spell! Prepare yourselves for sensory overload!"#br#
 Nash waves his arm exuberantly to the side with a flick of his wrist.
   #M322090$Nash$4$$0$0#

#&7$Darkslate Reptilion##br#
 Just as you're about to tell Nash to get his firmly-toned keister off your property#br#
 before you pump his guts full of lead, your pet Darkslate Reptilion slithers up behind#br#the motley pair, looking (to the best of your knowledge) more than a bit vexed.#M021010s50+10$Darkslate Reptilion$102$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Isn't that the same spell you were going to flaunt LAST time you oh-so-zealously#br#
 trespassed on our land? You know, the one that got snuffed before you so much as#br#
 singed a blade of grass?" %p%'s eyes narrow in apathetic skepticism.#pets100+30$$831$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
Suddenly, %p% notices your Reptilion in the background, which causes something#br# to click in the coney-shaped cogs of their mind, because they snap to attention quicker#br#
 than a bloodhound on high-alert. "Wait a minute... you're not gonna use that spell#br#
 on OUR Dragomon, are you?! You come into MY house-!!!"
 #pets100+30$$823$$1$0#

#&7$Nash##br#
"Wh-what? Of course, not! P-perish the thought, my lapine friend. I-I wouldn't#br# DREAM of laying a hand on these... adorable... CREATures of yours..."#br#
 Nash's upturned nose belies his attempt at defending himself as he glances#br#
 down at your scaly, dark-slated cash cow. #M322090$Nash$826$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Uh-huh, sure. That's why you were aBOUT to use it LAST time to send our#br#
 Crimson Claw up in flames, hm?" %p%'s hands go to their hips.
 #pets100+30$$4$$1$0#

#&7$Lenora##br#
"Wh-what?! Nash, how COULD you? Y-you told me... you told me..."#br# You can see the tears begin to well up in Lenora's big, brown eyes.
   #M324090$Lenora$826$$0$0#

#&7$Nash##br#
"I-if you would just let me explain, Lenora, you'd see that none of this is true!#br#
 S-simply unsupported accusations! The lot of them! And really, who'd expect#br#
 any less from uncultured peasants such as these, yes?" You can see Nash sweating. #M322090$Nash$821$$1$0#

#&7$Lenora##br#
"You promised, Nash! You promised! You said you'd never hurt another Dragomon#br#
 in front of me ever again! A-and now you're taking me here to... to..." Lenora's hands#br#
 go to her cheeks as she shakes her head, no doubt anxious to clear her mind of the#br#vile imagery plaguing it. #M324090$Lenora$825$$0$0#

#&7$Darkslate Reptilion##br#
"Hissssssssssssssss..." You turn at the sound of your Reptilion flicking its tongue#br#
 from between its lips—sometimes you're still surprised by how sssssnakelike it#br#
 can be—then see it instinctively scuttle behind Lenora for protection.#M021010s50+10$Darkslate Reptilion$101$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You, yourself, a bit at a loss for words (as well as how to deal with this situation),#br#
 are just about to suggest everyone come inside for some tea and a nice chat when#br#you're startled from your reverie by a high-pitched screech from behind you.#char$$2$$0$0#

#&7$Michaela##br#
"EeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!#br#
 HELP ME, NASH! I TAKE IT BACK! I take it BAAAAAAAAACK!"  
   #M807010s100+30$Michaela$304$$1$0#

#&7$Crimson Claw##br#
"Grraaaw... groooar... greeeeeewww..."#br#
 It's your Crimson Claw again! And he's still chasing Michaela.#br#
 You ponder how this turn of events could have realistically taken place,#br#but quickly realize the futility of it all and return to the matter at hand. #M003010s50+10$Crimson Claw$302$$0$0#

#&7$Michaela##br#
"Nash, I mean it! I really mean it! I take back everything I said!#br#
 Just... PLEASE! Use that stupid spell of yours to knock this lecherous#br#
 brute out again!!" Michaela's piercing wails disintegrate the very cilia#br#
 in your ears one by one. #M807010s100+30$Michaela$304$$1$0#

#&7$Nash##br#
"I-! You-! I-I don't know what you're talking about, Michaela! Seems you've been#br# playing with that DARling creature too long! It's starting to befuddle that brain#br#
 of yours, yes? For you see, I would NEVER do something like 'knock a Dragomon#br#
 out,' ahaha... ahahaha..." You can see the pit stains form like magic on Nash's jacket. #M322090$Nash$823$$0$0#

#&7$Lenora##br#
 Lenora, however, will hear none of it. Throwing her arms out with an exasperated#br#groan, she stomps off towards the entrance of your ranch without another word. #M324090$Lenora$351$$1$0#

#&7$Nash##br#
"W-wait! Lenora! I-I can explain! This is all just one big misunderstanding!"#br# Clutching his hat, Nash takes off after Lenora, leaving you and %p% standing#br#
 together in silent bewilderment. #M322090$Nash$301$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You turn towards %p%. %p% turns towards you.#br#The two of you shrug your shoulders and walk off.#char$$2$$1$0#

#&7$Michaela##br#
Michaela, meanwhile, continues to run for her life from the rabid, hunger-crazed#br#
 Crimson Claw intent on making her his delicately-boned bunny appetizer.#M807010s100+30$Michaela$304$$0$0#|
3518|#&7$Michaela##br#
"Heeeeeeeeeeeeelp! Won't ANYone help meeeeeeeeee?!?!#br#

"Rawry, rawry, GRRRAWR!""#M031010s40+10$Crystal Ursa$302$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
You and %p% turn somewhat lackadaisically from your work to stare off at Michaela's#br#
 form in the distance. Neither of you so much as raise an eyebrow. "Is she still here?"#pets100+30$$3$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You shrug your shoulders with a curt "seems like it," then go back to your work.#br#
 If Michaela wants to run Little Bunny Foo Foo with your Dragomon all day,#br# it's no concern of yours.#char$$826$$0$0#

#&7$Nash##br#
"What a miserable sight..."
   #M322090$Nash$826$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You and %p% practically leap out of your skins at Nash's sudden appearance
 behind you. You're so used to his grand entrances of gratuitous meretriciousness#br#
 that this creeping around like some kind of hunter on the prowl is more than a#br#little unnerving.#char$$823$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Cripes, Nash! You can't just sneak up on people like that all breathy and pasty!"#br#
 %p% points an accusative finger in Nash's face. "Though what gives? Not feeling#br#
 it today? Under the weather? You seem a little down about the mouth."#pets100+30$$3$$0$0#

#&7$Nash##br#
"Me? D-down about the mouth! Of course, not! Why, I've never been better!#br#
 And you'd better not forget it! I won't have vicious muckrakers likes you going#br#
 around spreading slander!" Nash points a finger back at %p%,#br#practically visible sparks erupting between them. #M322090$Nash$826$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Like I'd need to spread anything to tarnish your name! The whole city already#br#
 thinks you're a pretentious dandy, you twit!" You see the flush rise to %p%'s face.
 #pets100+30$$831$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Nash turns with an abrupt swish of his jacket, all of a sudden in no mood—it would#br#seem—to continue this altercation. You can't help but find his conspicuous melancholy#br#more than a little strange.#char$$826$$0$0#

#&7$Michaela##br#
"NaaaaaaAAAAAAAAASSSHHHH! If you don't help me this instant#br#
 I'll never forgive you! Never, ever, ever in my whole life! So get that flame-#br#
 brained head of yours over here PRONTO and TAKE THIS THING OUT!"#br#
 Michaela seems to be running in your direction. #M807010s100+30$Michaela$304$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You're just wondering if Nash really IS going to help her this time when a brilliant#br#
 flash of purple light catches your attention. Spinning around on your heels, you notice#br#that Nash has disappeared.#char$$823$$1$0#

"Celestial Inferno of Dragon Devastation..."#M322090$Nash$601$$0$0#

#&7$Crystal Ursa##br#
"Urgh? Ugghghggh!! RRRAAAWWWRR---!"#br#
 Your Crystal Ursa lets out a ear-shattering roar of excrutiating pain,#br#
 then abruptly falls to the ground, a wriggling, flailing mass of bear limbs. #M031010s40+10$Crystal Ursa$401$$0$0#

#&7$Nash##br#
"...."#M322090$Nash$1$$0$0#

 It takes you a second to even register what's just happened, and by the time#br#
 you have, your Crystal Ursa has fainted dead away in the grass of your pasture. #M031010s40+10$Crystal Ursa$504$$1$0#

#&7$Michaela##br#
"For CRYING OUT LOUD! It TOOK you long enough! I almost DIED, Nash.#br#
 DIED! The big sleep! The great gig in the sky! I don't care HOW much your#br#
 oh-so-fragile heart got broken, you DON'T leave your companion out to dry!"#br#
 The near-death experience has in no way affected Michaela's mouth, you notice wryly.#M807010s100+30$Michaela$825$$1$0#

#&7$Nash##br#
"..."#br#
 Nash doesn't even seem to have noticed Michaela's incessant prattling,#br#
 instead, staring off somewhere into the distance before walking off without#br#a word. #M322090$Nash$351$$0$0#

#&7$Michaela##br#
"HEY! You don't just leave when I'm TALKING to you!#br#
 Get BACK here! Nash! NAAAAAAAAAAAAAAASH!!"#br#
 Michaela takes off after the woebegone magician, her little bunny#br#feet a frenzied blur of motion in her attempt at apprehension. #M807010s100+30$Michaela$303$$1$0#|
3519|#&7$%n%##br#
 You and %p% are just returning to your ranch after a busy day of poaching hapless#br#
 creatures when you happen to catch sight of a visage most strange—your Bloody#br#Ape! And he has two Hoppalongs happily chatting upon his back. #M027010s50+10$Bloody Ape$1$$0$0#

#&7$Michaela##br#
"You know, Silus, I've been meaning to ask you something. Normally, I don't feel#br#
 the need to rely on guidance from others, but you strike me as the sort of Hoppalong#br#who thrives on observing others quietly from the sidelines. You wouldn't happen to#br#know why it is that Nash is so fond of Lenora, would you?" #M807010s100+30$Michaela$831$$1$0#

#&7$Silus##br#
"..."#br#
 Silus continues staring at the other Hoppalong in wordless quietude. #M811010s100+30$Silus$1$$0$0#

#&7$Michaela##br#
"It seems picking your brain will be harder than I'd first thought. So be it! I have a#br#
 plan. You need not utter a single word—NO! I shall simply ask you a yes or no#br#
 question, and if you could simply nod your head, that would be SPLENDID."#br#Michaela chuckles to herself as though she's just discovered the atom. #M807010s100+30$Michaela$831$$1$0#

#&7$Michaela##br#
"Now, let's see... could it be because that overweening narcissist admires#br#
 Lenora's, hrm... unUSUal personality?" Michaela's eyes narrow in dubiety. #M807010s100+30$Michaela$823$$1$0#

#&7$Michaela##br#
"No again? Hmm... perhaps it's the pallid hue of her skin, then?"
   #M807010s100+30$Michaela$2$$1$0#

#&7$Silus##br#
 Silus shakes his head again and again.#M811010s100+30$Silus$1$$0$0#

#&7$Michaela##br#
 The strange interrogation continues for a while—Michaela growing more#br#
 and more irate with each passing question—until she can finally take it no#br#
 more. Silus simply keeps shaking his head again, and again, and again... #M807010s100+30$Michaela$831$$1$0#

#&7$Michaela##br#
"D-dear me, m-... my beautiful voice is becoming QUITE strained..."#br# Michaela coughs into her hand, brows wrinkling. "Silus! Stop playing#br#
 games with me! Do you even know the answer or are you simply#br#
 stringing me along?!" #M807010s100+30$Michaela$826$$1$0#

#&7$Silus##br#
 Silus finally, decidedly, and almost contentedly, nods.#M811010s100+30$Silus$1$$0$0#

#&7$Michaela##br#
"What was that in response to? My first question or my second question?#br#
 What is wrong with you?! WHY WON'T YOU TALK, YOU UNGRATEFUL#br#
 LITTLE TURD?!?" Michaela grabs Silus by the collar and shakes him vigorously. #M807010s100+30$Michaela$825$$1$0#

#&7$Silus##br#
 Silus blinks in rapt silence, simply staring up into Michaela's increasingly-more#br#
 bloodshot eyes. Finally, he turns his gaze away, instead focusing on the nearby#br#
 horns on your Bloody Ape's head. #M811010s100+30$Silus$1$$0$0#

#&7$Michaela##br#
"Wh-... what is THAT supposed to mean? What is that supposed to mean?!#br#
 WHAT IS THAT SUPPOSED TO MEEEEEAAAAN?!?" #M807010s100+30$Michaela$831$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
 The tiniest little snicker catches your attention, and you glance down to see#br#
 %p% chuckling beneath their breath, clearly amused. You have no idea#br#what's going on, but something tells you you're better off that way...#pets100+30$$824$$0$0#|
3520|#&7$Toxavian##br#
"Chirp, chirp! Chirrrrrrrrrup!"
 Your fine-feather-boned Toxavian flaps its wings in a grandiose arc,#br#cawing at the sky. #M012010s40$Toxavian$2$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"%n%! %n%! %n%! S-someone's playing with your Toxavian!#br#
 Look over there!" %p% suddenly starts running towards you from#br#the other side of the ranch.#pets100+30$$823$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Thinking %p% must be horribly confused, you follow the direction of their pointing#br#
 finger and see that your Toxavian is, in fact, in the company of a visitor to your ranch.#br#
 Said visitor turns out to be Fate, who's currently taking a dip in... the biological#br#waste of your Toxavian?!?!#char$$2$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Sweet, sultry sassafras! What in the world's gotten into that girl?!"#br#
 Almost as soon as %p% approaches you, they veer off to the right, course-#br#
 correcting themselves towards Fate's "steamy" situation.#pets100+30$$831$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You take off, as well, unsure why anyone would think bathing in waste of any kind—let#br#
 ALONE toxic waste—would be a good idea. Upon reaching Fate and her homemade#br#hot springs, you grab her by her tiny paws and yank her from the bubbling liquid.#char$$301$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"F-FATE! What on earth were you THINKING?!#br#
 And besides, what're you doing on our ranch? I thought#br#
 you were forbidden from taking off on your own!"#br#
 %p% nearly hacks up a lung upon inhaling the fumes of the Toxavian waste.#pets100+30$$826$$1$0#

#&7$Fate##br#
"I had to leave in order to complete... my experiment..."#br#
 Fate's voice is slow and methodical as chunky gobs of toxic#br#
 feculence run rivulets down her legs. #M808010s100+30$Fate$831$$$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You ask Fate what kind of experiment would involve bathing#br#
 in a noxious smattering of Toxavian fecal matter.#char$$826$$1$0#

#&7$Fate##br#
"Marvin told me that... Toxavian swamp puddles boast a series of...#br#
 highly beneficial... properties... upon immersion..."
 #M808010s100+30$Fate$831$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Marvin?! Why would you believe ANYthing that moneygrubber told you?#br# All he's ever after is a quick buck, and he'd throw his own best friend under#br#
 the bus to get it! First Mholt... now Fate!" %p% shakes their head in#br# disbelieving misery.
 #pets100+30$$825$$1$0#

#&7$Fate##br#
"Marvin was... telling the truth...#br# I've already... ascertained as... such..."
  #M808010s100+30$Fate$831$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Curious, you ask Fate just what it is that Marvin had told her, as well#br#
 as just what it is that Fate had "ascertained."#char$$4$$1$0#

#&7$Fate##br#
"Marvin told me that... Toxavian swamp puddles boast a series of...#br#
 We Hoppalongs seem to possess... a certain kind of antibody that... nullifies the toxins..."
 #M808010s100+30$Fate$831$$0$0#

#&7$Fate##br#
"He also said that... if we were to extract this antibody... we could sell it to... humans.#br#
 He promised to share the... profits with me so I could... continue my research..."
  
 #M808010s100+30$Fate$821$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Fate, I'm pretty sure those 'highly beneficial properties' Marvin promised were#br#
 nothing more than the highly beneficial greenbacks he wanted to slap into his hand#br#
 at the end of this ridiculous scheme. What makes you think Marvin would share#br#
 ANY of his money with you, huh?" %p% raises an incredulous eyebrow.#pets100+30$$831$$1$0#

#&7$Fate##br#
"I don't... know, but... I'm not finished with the... experiment, yet...#br#
 I have many more... readings to take, so I'll... have to talk to you... later."#br# Fate slowly turns around—still reeking of toxic filth—and walks towards#br#
 the entrance of your ranch without another word.  
   #M808010s100+30$Fate$301$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Crossing your arms over your chest, a sudden idea hits you like a brick to the face.#br#
 What if YOU were to find the antibody FIRST? This could be your big break! You#br#
 could be the richest hunter in all of Wyveria!! You turn towards %p% with a#br#lascivious smile...#char$$805$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
 "Wh-wh-what is THAT look for? Don't you give me that look! I ain't anti-bodying#br#
NO one! S-s-stop staring at me like that!" %p% takes first one step, and then another#br#
 step backwards, their eyes widening in burgeoning horror. #pets100+30$$827$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You simply creep after them, slowly leading them towards the sizzling pit...#char$$1$$0$0#|
3521|#&7$%n%##br#
 You've just set out to take a relaxing stroll around your ranch when you happen#br#to hear a bit of giggling from not so far off. Curious, you head in the direction of the#br#high-spirited frivolity and see %p% having FAR too much fun playing with your Megadactyl.#char$$821$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 About to chalk it up as nothing more than a pair of goons having a bit of a romp,#br#
 you've just turned on your heels when you realize there was actually something#br#very, VERY wrong with the picture you'd just seen. %p% had been... inside the#br#Megadactyl's MOUTH?!#char$$821$$0$0# #M006010s30+20$Megadactyl$4$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Afraid for the life of your nearest and dearest friend, you scramble towards the#br#
 Megadactyl as fast as you can and bash the brute across the snoot,#br#nabbing %p% from its jaws.#char$$30106$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"%n%? Oh, hey! What're you doin' here, huh? Where'd you come from?"#br#
 %p% looks up at you in a state of confusion, their big eyes blinking rapidly.#pets100+30$$823$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Hey! What happened to old Mega? Poor thing! Looks like someone clobbered#br# him over the head!" %p% turns towards your Megadactyl with a worried murmur.
 #pets100+30$$823$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Anxious to make sure %p% isn't hurt, you check them over from top to bottom.#br#
 Once you've reached the conclusion that %p% is unharmed, you let out a sigh of#br#
 relief and finally go into details about what just transpired.#char$$823$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Whaaaaaa? Mega would NEVER do something like that! He and I're best buds!#br#
 Aren't we, Mega? Huh? We love playing all kinds of stuff! He especially loves the#br#
 game where I pretend to be an innocent lamb out in the pasture and he's the big#br#
 bad wolf come to gobble me up!" %p%'s eyes light up with unbridled exuberance.#pets100+30$$821$$1$0#

#&7$Megadactyl##br#
 The Megadactyl nods its head with a strangely voracious purr, eying%p%#br#
 with a look that makes you hold the small rabbit all the more tightly against your#br#
 chest. When it notices your protectiveness, the Megadactyl's shoulders (at least you#br#
 THINK they're its shoulders) sag in defeat, and it turns its head. #M006010s30+20$Megadactyl$1$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You weren't born yesterday—you know that look! That look was the look of a ravenous#br#
 beast! There's no doubt in your mind that the Megadactyl wants nothing more than#br#
 to take a big, thick bite from your companion's plump little body. If only %p%#br#weren't so naïve!#char$$826$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 There's no WAY you're going to leave %p% here with this monster a single second#br#
 more! Next thing you know, you'll be cleaning %p%'s bones out of this cursed#br#dactyl's droppings!#char$$826$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 It seems you've no choice. You lead %p% away from the pen quietly—not#br#
 wanting to make a scene—then prepare your axe. It just has to be this way.#br#It just has to...#char$$4$$1$0#|
3522|#&7$%p%##br#
You and %p% are on your way to your ranch when they turn towards you with a start.#br#
 "Say, %n%... you haven't noticed anything, well, OFF about our Gorehorn lately,#br#
 have you? You know, things like a complete lack of energy, abnormal twitching,#br#
 loss of motivation, more and more hours spent locked in its pen refusing to come out?"#pets100+30$$821$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Given that the weather is the way it is, and the Granite Gorehorn is covered with rock,#br#
 it might be that it's feeling a bit depressed as of late.#char$$4$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"But do not fret!#br#
 I've managed to discover a method to bring our beloved Granite Gorehorn back to normal!"#br#
 %p% waves a red handkerchief wildly over their head.#pets100+30$$821$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Upon seeing the red handkerchief in %p%'s hand,#br#
 a wave of uneasiness washes over you.#char$$826$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"My most dearest Granite Gorehorn! We're over here!"#br#
 %p% shouts towards the Granite Gorehorn while vigorously waving the handerchief.#pets100+30$$821$$0$0#

#&7$Granite Gorehorn##br#
 When they first started approaching the Granite Gorehorn, it was just lazily lying down,#br#
 but as soon as it spotted %p% waving the red handkerchief, it shot up.#br#
 You notice a red hue in its eyes which only grows stronger as it stares at the handkerchief.#br#
 The Granite Gorehorn reards back and assumes a striking position. #M024010s50+10$Granite Gorehorn$3$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Oh look! I knew it would work! The Granite Gorehorn is look much better already. The book was right!"#br#
 You realize that %p% has no idea what they're doing as they pause for a second to look at you.#pets100+30$$821$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
 Just as %p% raises their hand again to keep waving at the Granite Gorhorn,#br#
 it suddenly springs forward and charges at %p%.#pets100+30$$821$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Right before the Granite Gorehorn slams into %p%,#br#
 you snatch %p% up with your hand and yank him out of the Granite Gorehorn's way.#br#
 You then grab the handkerchief from %p%'s hand and toss it to the side.#char$$823$$1$0#

#&7$Granite Gorehorn##br#
 Seeing the handkerchief fly in the opposite direction, the Granite Gorehorn#br#
 slams on the brakes and turns back to the handkerchief as it floats down to the ground.#br#
 Just before it lands, the Granite Gorehorn bites it out of the air, and proceeds to ripping it apart.#br#
 After there's nothing left, it goes back to its normal state of laziness. #M024010s50+10$Granite Gorehorn$301$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
 %p% is completely confused by everything that just occurred.#br#
"I don't get it... Does that mean that our Granite Gorehorn doesn't like red after all?#br#
 That means... That means the book was wrong!"#pets100+30$$831$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Although you aren't too sure about whether it was the color that enraged the Granite Gorehorn,#br#
 you can't really put your finger on what the exact reason was,#br#
 so you tell %p% what you think may have happened,#br#
 and ask them to stop trying to find strange new solutions to existing problems.#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Ohhhhhhh. That makes sense! It must definitely be the hot weather.#br#
 You're right then. We should leave the Granite Gorehorn alone. It could use a rest."#pets100+30$$822$$1$0#|
3523|#&7$%n%##br#
 You're out on a relaxing walk around the Ranch,#br#
 when you notice that all of the Dragomon have food,#br#
 except for the Armordillo, who doesn't even have a bowl!#br#
 You hope that %p% isn't punishing the Armordillo for any reason.#char$$825$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You turn to find %p% walking up behind you,#br#
 and you tell them that even if the Armordillo isn't as cute at the other Dragomon,#br#
 it still deserves to have its fair share of food!#char$$803$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
 %p% seems to just shrug off your words,#br#
 and just stares at you, almost as if insulted by your statement.#br#
"Why do you assume I did anything to the Armordillo?! It'll figure things out on its own."#pets100+30$$826$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 %p%'s nonchalant attitude towards you is starting to get on your nerves.#br#
 It WAS %p% who wanted to raise the Armordillo so badly after all.#br#
 You figured that %p% would be a bit more responsible in taking care of the Dragomon!#char$$803$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
 %p% starts to defend themselves and says,#br#
"But seriously, it's the truth! Wait until the Armordillo wakes and you'll see! It's not all my fault!"#pets100+30$$831$$1$0# 

#&7$%n%##br#
 %p% seems to be a bit more guilty than he seems, #br#
 so you decide to wait and see.#br#
 You and %p% hang around a bit to see if the Armordillo wakes up.#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Armordillo##br#
 After what seems like an eternity, the Armordillo finally wakes up.#br#
 It groggily starts to stretch out and then seems to look around for food. #M015010s30+45$Armordillo$4$$1$0#

#&7$Armordillo##br#
 You notice that two fairies have appeared on the Armordillo's back.#br#
 One of them is on the ground and searching for earthworms,#br#
 the other one is up in the sky and collecting fruits from the trees.#br#
 The Armordillo is happily munching on the earthworms and fruits at the same time. #M015010s30+45$Armordillo$503$$1$0#

#&7$Armordillo##br#
 You can tell that the Armordillo is loving every moment of it. #M015010s30+45$Armordillo$2$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Now everything seems to make sense.#char$$825$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Nooooow you see? And you thought I did something wrong. The Armordillo doesn't need my help.#br#
 Besides, the Armordillo doesn't even like the fodder that we have."#br#
 %p% relishes in the moment.#pets100+30$$827$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Just by looking at the way they're acting, you realize that you've treated %p% unfairly,#br#
 and you try to get back in their good graces.#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Hmmm, I mean if you're gonna say that then, alright, I'll forgive you!"#br#
 %p% says joyfully.#pets100+30$$821$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You smile and can't help but#br#
 rub %p%'s head playfully.#br#
 You swing your arm over their shoulder and you both walk off into the sunset.#char$$1$$0$0#|
3524|#&7$%n%##br#
 As you and %p% are forking the fodder from the feed wagon into the bowls,#br#
 %p% stops suddenly,#br#
 and stares at the Cobalt Wyvern that's hanging out nearby  #M009010s40$Cobalt Wyvern$1$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"You know... we've had this Cobalt Wyvern for a long time now.#br#
 I was just noticing that its skin and back spikes#br#
 are in fantastic condition."#pets100+30$$831$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"But I never really noticed something,#br#
 and I feel really silly for not having seen it.#br#
 Did you know that there are also spikes under its wings?" #M009010s40$Cobalt Wyvern$2$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You also feel a bit silly for not having seen it.
 It's true though!#br# 
 The Cobalt Wyvern also has spikes under its wings!#char$$823$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"It's a bit odd though. It must really hurt to have spikes under the wings.#br#
 Whenever it flaps its wings, it must really hurt!"#br#
 %p% shivers with empathy.#pets100+30$$831$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"You know what? I bet we can help out our Cobalt Wyvern by taking out the spikes!#br#
 Even though it's never complained, it would be pretty bad if it got injured because of them.#br#
 I'll go find tools that'll help us take them out!"#br#
 %p% immediately rushes off to the blacksmith.#pets100+30$$304$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You look back at the Cobalt Wyvern and the spikes under its wings.#br#
 It gives you something to think about...#char$$2$$0$0#|
3525|#&7$%p%##br#
"Ah, I know that very well... I completely understand.#br#
 I definitely know how it feels to be taken advantage of by others..."#br#
 You notice a Stone Leviathan and %p% lying on the grass chatting.#br#
 It's a lovely night but the topic of discussions seems awfully depressing.#pets100+30$$831$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Like %n%#br#
 always forces me to kill Dragomon even though I don't want to.#br#
 Do I LOOK like a killer? I think not!#br#
 I can be a conscientious objector too!"#pets100+30$$831$$0$0#

#&7$Stone Leviathan##br#
"Roar!!!!!"#br#
 Stone Leviathan nods,#br#
 seemingly in agreement to everything that %p% just said. #M037010s30+30$Stone Leviathan$1$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"I'm serious! We Hoppalongs used to live with Dragomon quite amicably,#br#
 that is until the hunters came.#br#
 That's when things really changed for us.#br#
 We were forced to kill or be killed!"#pets100+30$$831$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"From what you just said, I think we can both agree,#br#
 the real problem is those hunters!#br#
 It's about time that they hunters become the hunted!"#br#
 %p% seems to have understood everything and continues nodding.#pets100+30$$1$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Well I guess things may never change.#br#
 Those annoying hunters seem to be sticking around for good.#br#
 As long as they do, we can only follow their orders and obey them.#br#
 This might be the rest of our lives as we know it."#pets100+30$$826$$0$0#

#&7$Stone Leviathan##br#
"Roar..."#br#
 The Stone Leviathan seems to agree again, this time#br#
 roaring a bit more despairingly. #M037010s30+30$Stone Leviathan$601$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Come on, don't be so pessimistic!#br#
 You still have me here with you!"#br#
 %p% pats the Stone Leviathan's head tenderly.#pets100+30$$821$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"One day. One day I shall find a way to end this needless fighting between us and the Dragomon.#br#
 I will bring these meaningless battles and hunts to an end,#br#
 and we will finally live in peace!"#pets100+30$$821$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
 Lost in their own conversation,#br#
 the Stone Leviathan and %p% talk endlessly under the beautiful night sky,
 until they both finally fall asleep.#pets100+30$$831$$0$0#|
3526|#&7$Eren##br#
"SILUS? Silus, what are you going?"#br#
 You look in the direction of the screaming to see Eren grabbing Silus with both arms,#br#
 and shaking him back and forth. #M810010s100+30$Eren$825$$1$0#

#&7$Silus##br#
 Silus seems to be staring at some shining bait,#br#
 and he starts to calmly walk towards a Sea Scourge. #M811010s100+30$Silus$301$$0$0#

#&7$Eren##br#
"Wake up! WAKE UP! HELLOOOO!#br#
 Silus, if you keep on going, you'll... you'll get killed!"#br#
 Eren shouts at Silus, fearing for his life.#br#
 Silus keeps on walking towards the Sea Scourge, paying no attention to Eren. #M810010s100+30$Eren$825$$1$0#

#&7$Sea Scourge##br#
 Just as Silus draws near, the Sea Scourge opens its huge mouth,#br#
 ready to devour him in one bite. #M114010s30+40$Sea Scourge$601$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You dart towards Silus, reaching him just before the Sea Scourge bites down,#br#
 and you violently pull him back, wrenching him out of the Sea Scourge's spell.#char$$825$$0$0#

#&7$Eren##br#
"Silus! Are you alright?#br#
 You almost got devoured by that Sea Scourge! Didn't you notice?#br# DEVOURED. DEVOURED. VOURED#br#
 Eren shouts at Silus, slapping him a few times,
 until he's finally conscious again. #M810010s100+30$Eren$30006$$1$0#

#&7$Silus##br#
"...?"#br#
 Silus looks up at you in complete confusion,#br#
 as he touches his swollen cheek. #M811010s100+30$Silus$823$$0$0#

 Hoping to clear up his confusion, you explain to Silus what just happened,#br#

#&7$Eren##br#
"You should really be thankful that I'm always with you! Otherwise you'd have totally kicked the bucket."#br#
 Eren and Silus both thank you for your help, and leave.#br#
 As they walk away, you can hear Eren still teasing Silus. #M810010s100+30$Eren$821$$0$0#

 After what just happened, you get to thinking,#br#

 %p% continues the long lecture on proper etiquette.#pets100+30$$825$$0$0#

#&7$Ruby Rex##br#
 Ruby Rex's scales start to turn into a more vivid shade of red,#br#
 and black smoke beings to billow out of its mouth.#br#
 Somehow %p% hasn't noticed the beast's sudden change in temperament. #M051010s40+10$Ruby Rex$4$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"I saaaaaaid—EAT LIKE A GENTLEMON!#br#
 It isn't even that hard... IS IT?"#pets100+30$$831$$0$0#

#&7$Ruby Rex##br#
 Out of nowhere,#br#
 the Ruby Rex lets out a loud, and extended burp#br#
 with towering flames and smoke.#br#
 %p% happens to have been standing directly in front of the Ruby Rex. #M051010s40+10$Ruby Rex$2041$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
 As soon as the smoke disperses,#br#
 you notice %p% standing there, their hair smoky and burnt to a crisp.#br#
"You.. WILL.. PAY... FOR THIS!"#pets100+30$$826$$0$0#

#&7$Ruby Rex##br#
 %p% wobbles back and forth momentarily, and then their eyes roll back as they faint.#br#
 The Ruby Rex seems to shrug and goes back to eating, almost as if nothing happened. #M051010s40+10$Ruby Rex$503$$1$0#|

"Ahhh! Noooo! Let me down!"#br#
 As you're raking leaves on the ground,#br#
 you suddenly hear %p% screaming from the direction of the warehouse.#pets100+30$$824$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Ahhh! No... i-it tickles! Ahhhhhhh!"#br#
 You wonder what what is happening so you open the warehouse door#br#
 to see a Carnivine holding %p% with its tentacle,#br#
 happily swinging them back and forth. #M111010s110+10$Carnivine$4$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Oh! Look! It's %n%!#br#
 I asked the Carnivine to give me a lift#br#
 because I wanted to know how it felt to fly!"#br#
 %p% explains, hoping to disperse your confusion.#pets100+30$$831$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Okay, Carnivine, I'm ready now!#br#
 Throw me up into the sky!#br#
 But you better not forget to catch me!"#br#
 %p% says, slightly worried. #M111010s110+10$Carnivine$102$$1$0#

#&7$Carnivine##br#
"Roar!!!!!"#br#
 The Carnivine gives out a roar,#br#
 and tosses %p% up as high as it can. #M111010s110+10$Carnivine$4$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
"Bang!"#br#
 %p% slams face-first into the ceiling of the warehouse.#br#
 They seem to have completely forgotten that they are still indoors.#char$$826$$0$0#

#&7$Carnivine##br#
 The Carnivine looks up at %p% who's still glued to the ceiling.#br#
 Although the Carnivine is ready to catch %p%,#br#
 %p% forgot to tell them what they should do if they're glued to the ceiling. #M111010s110+10$Carnivine$1$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Surprisingly, this is no real surprise to you,#br#
 so you shake your head and walk out of the warehouse.#br#
 %p% is always getting into trouble and this is nothing, but you do hope they'll be alright.#char$$821$$0$0#|
3529|#&7$Terrible Treant##br#
 With the start of the rainy season, everything is starting to grow again,#br#
 including all of the leaves on the Terrible Treant.#br#
 It's become so bad that their whole face is now covered with leaves. #M096010s50$Terrible Treant$1$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"I promise that I'm just going to trim the leaves away,#br#
 not the branches!"#br#
 %p% cautiously clambers up onto the Terrible Treant's head,#br#
 wiggling themselves in between all of the branches.#pets100+30$$831$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 In this here book it says that#br#
 the Terrible Treant's new leaves,
 are JUST like human hair.#br#
 You can cut them and they won't even feel it!#char$$821$$0$0#

 As long as you don't trim the branches, you're fine.#br#
 They're more like human flesh, it says.#br#
 I'm sure that if you cut those, well,#br#
 well the results won't be pretty!#char$$826$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
But don't you worry your green little head,#br#
 I'm the best gardener there ever was!"#br#
 %p% starts to cut off the leaves with real panache,#br#
 just to prove to everyone that they really are the best gardener around.#pets100+30$$821$$1$0#

#&7$Terrible Treant##br#
"Cut!"#br#
 The Terrible Treant shivers violently.#br#
 It's almost as if %p% accidentally snipped a branch.#br#
 The Terrible Treant now sits very, very still. #M096010s50$Terrible Treant$2$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Man, I'm just SO good at this gardening thing.#br#
 I should probably open up a class just so others can see how good I am at it."#br#
 %p% seems completely unaware that they accidentally cut a branch,#br#
 and they continue going on, and on about their skills.#pets100+30$$821$$1$0#

#&7$Terrible Treant##br#
"Cut!" "Cut!"#br#
 %p% seems to have made an even bigger cut this time.#br#
 The Terrible Treant shivers once again,#br#
 and grabs onto %p%. #M096010s50$Terrible Treant$4$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Whoa, hold on buddy! I'm not quite done yet!#br#
 You can still thank me when I finish."#br#
 %p% has absolutely no idea about what's going on.#pets100+30$$821$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Having seen enough, you rush over,#br#
 and holler at %p% to leave the Terrible Treant alone.#br#
 Though it seems like you may have been a tad too late.#char$$826$$0$0#

#&7$Terrible Treant##br#
 The Terrible Treant suddenly swings its branches wildly. #M096010s50$Terrible Treant$4$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
 %p% can't hold on and ends up being flung way off into the distance.#br#
"Ahhh! AHHHHHHH! HEEEEEEEEeeeeeeeelllllpppp!"#br#
 %p%'s loud screams slowly fade into the distance.#pets100+30$$825$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You close your eyes and hope that %p% landed somewhere safely.#br#
 You don't know how they constantly manage to get into trouble,#br#
 but maybe its about time you hire some professionals to do the difficult work around here.#char$$821$$1$0#|
3530|#&7$%n%##br#
 After what seems like an eternity of torrential rain,#br#
 the sun finally peeks over the horizon.#br#
 With the bright light, you notice that a lot of mushrooms have appeared on the Ranch,#br#
 so you decide that it's time to take care of the problem before it gets any worse.#char$$826$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
 While you're dealing with annoyingly sticky mushrooms,#br#
 you look up to see %p% run over,#br#
 pause for a moment, start to creep around,#br#
 and finally dash towards the Spiky Tortank.#pets100+30$$823$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Curious as to what they're up to,#br#
 you decide to follow %p%,#br#
 and see if %p% trying to hide something from you.#char$$2$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
 You continue to follow them and you end up back at the Ranch.#br#
"Don't you move, Spiky Tortank! I'm gonna glue your horn back now!#br#
 We had a deal and I intend to keep it! But please remember not to tel %n% about this, comprende?"#br#
 You finally catch up to see %p% talk to the Spiky Tortank.#pets100+30$$831$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Oh yeah! In order to repay you, I'll bring you Omi's special meal tomorrow.#br#
 Though, to be fair, you're also partly to blame for this.#br#
 If you weren't so intent on playing with me,#br#
 I wouldn't have broken your horn off!"#pets100+30$$831$$1$0#

#&7$Spiky Tortank##br#
 The Spiky Tortank doesn't seem to agree with %p%,#br#
 and it begins to pace angrily back and forth,#br#
 knocking everything over and spilling the glue out of its bucket. #M075010s40+30$Spiky Tortank$3$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Stoooop! What's gotten into you?#br#
 My feet! They're stuck to the ground!!"#br#
 %p% stepped into the glue that had been spilled and now they're glued to the floor.

#&7$Spiky Tortank##br#
 The Spiky Tortank is not bothered by #br#'s predicament,
 and finally walks over to the box of fodder. #M075010s40+30$Spiky Tortank$351$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"How could you betray me like this? After everything I've done?!#br#
 I came ALL of this way just to glue your darn horn back on!"#br#
 %p% stares at the Spiky Tortank, their blood boiling.#br#
 Still unfazed, the Spiky Tortank continues trodding over to the fodder box.#pets100+30$$827$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
 It's such a beautiful, sunny day,#br#
 yet poor %p% insists on standing alone in the middle of the greass,#br#
 telling people about the evils of the Spiky Tortank.#pets100+30$$825$$1$0#|

"Hmm, is that so? I must say, I think it'll also look good with a picture of a flame as well."#pets100+30$$821$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 After a long day of taking care of chores around the Ranch,#br#
 you meet up with %p% and a Lampreying Mantis on the way back.#br#
 They are just happily chatting with each other.#char$$2$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Hey! %n%! We're over here!"#br#
 %p% shouts in your direction,#br#
 while waving his hands to get your attention.#pets100+30$$821$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
I was just in a discussion with the Lampreying Mantis about how to transform its outer shell in the future!#br#
 The problem is that it's awfully pricey..."#br#
 %p% continues on, excited about the topic of the day.#pets100+30$$831$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
It's really tough to find a skilled sheet metal specialist in this day and age,#br#
 Maybe I can ask Enkidu if he's got any ideas,#br#
 or if he knows of anyone who's highly skilled."#br#
 %p% says while the Lampreying Mantis happily shakes its head.#pets100+30$$831$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"But anyway, after that comes painting!"#br#
 %p% nods in agreement.#pets100+30$$831$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"If you ask me, I think you should paint it red!
 Hmm, no?... How about we paint it black?#br# No? You prefer a more natural feeling? Maybe a sky blue?#br#
 %p% starts to discuss with the Lampreying Mantic about possible colors. #M125010s70$Lampreying Mantis$4$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Yeah?! We'll paint it sky blue then!#br#
 I still prefer red though... Red brings all the girls to the yard!"#br#
 %p% says, a bit annoyed that their preference wasn't chosen,#br# 
 even though it's not them who's getting painted.#pets100+30$$831$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"So how about patterns? Anything cool in mind?"#br#
 It seems like this topic has been bothering %p%#br#
 and the Lampreying Mantis for quite a while now.#pets100+30$$1$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"I think the biggest issue that we need to deal with is,#br#
 exactly how do manage to cover the cost of it all?"#br#
 %p% and the Lampreying Mantis turn to look at you. #M125010s70$Lampreying Mantis$2$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You're so lost that all you can manage to do is shake your head,#br#
 claiming that there's no way you can afford any of this.#char$$821$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Wah! Really? If %n% can't manage to pay for it right now,#br#
 how about we sell their kidneys?"#br#
 %p% squints at you,#br#
 then down to where your kidneys would be.#pets100+30$$831$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You step back and immediately refuse,#br#
 saying that they really shouldn't be spending money they don't have.#char$$821$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Well, I guess we're foiled, for now... Maybe one day you'll wake up and... well... hehe"#br#
 %p% continues staring at  your kidneys,#br#
 rather annoyingly.#pets100+30$$831$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 As you head back home,#br#
 you feel an odd tinge of pain in your kidneys.#br#
 Sleeping at night is going to be a bit of problem...#char$$826$$0$0# |

"You seem a bit... pudgier. Don't you think?"#br#

#&7$Hammerdactyl##br#
 The Hammerdactyl looks down at its bulging belly.#br#
"Roar..."#br#
 It seems kind of angry at the mention of it,#br#
 but it also kind of agrees. #M068010s30+10$Hammerdactyl$2$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"You can't keep going on like this!#br#
 Haven't you read any of the latest science journals?#br#
 It's just not good for your health!"#br#
 %p% continues educating the Hammerdactyl.#pets100+30$$831$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Let me propose something! We can exercise together starting from today.#br#
 We'll keep at it until you have a six pack."#br#
 %p% tries to flex his abs to show off.#br#
 Apparently it's not working right now...#pets100+30$$821$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Alright, let's do it to it!#br#
 Today is the start of a whole new you!"#br#
 %p% points to the Hammerdactyl and together they stand up to exercise.#br#
"First we'll take a meditation break."#pets100+30$$831$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"And one, two-thre, one, two-three! Yeah, that's it! Keep at it! And... whoaaaa!"#br#
 Even though they're just warming up,#br#
 the Hammerdactyl is enjoying itself so much,#br#
 that it accidentally hit %p%'s face with one of its wings.#pets100+30$$201$$0$0#

#&7$Hammerdactyl##br#
"Roar..."#br#
 The Hammerdactyl checks to see if the unconscious %p% is still breathing.#br#
"You... good... we... continue."#br#
 %p% stands up shakily and continue. #M068010s30+10$Hammerdactyl$4$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Five more, four more, three... AHHHH!"#br#
 The Hammerdactyl is a bit too excited about the workout,#br#
 and topples over, landing right on top,#br#
 of the extremely unlucky %p%.#pets100+30$$504$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Hey... get. Up. You. Argh."#br#
 %p% is stuck under the Hammerdactyl's belly,#br#
 and doesn't seem to be able to breathe properly.#pets100+30$$504$$0$0#

#&7$Hammerdactyl##br#
"Roar!"#br#
 The Hammerdactyl finally realizes that there's someone under its belly. #M068010s30+10$Hammerdactyl$2$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Thought... you... left... we... continue."#br#
 %p% faints from a lack of oxygen.#br#
 The Hammerdactyl is totally bemused.#pets100+30$$401$$0$0#|

 Wow, it sure is a beautiful day today!#br#

#&7$Stoneray##br#
 and see the Stoneray happily floating around. #M116010s50+10$Stoneray$1$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You smile at it, but suddenly realize that there's something amiss.#br#
 How is it possible that a Stoneray can be floating in mid-air?#br#
 It has to be some sort of holographic image...#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"%n%! %n%!"#br#

 %p% comes running to you, looking very worried.#pets100+30$$831$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Is there something wrong?#br#
 Why are you just standing here and staring at the Stoneray?"#br#
 %p% asks.#pets100+30$$831$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Speaking of the Stoneray, you turn your attention back to it,#br#
 and point out to %p%#br#
 that a Stoneray is somehow floating in the air.#char$$821$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Of course I know! I'm not blind!#br#
 I've heard tales like this one from our ancestors.#br#
 There was a time when we Hoppalongs wanted to deafet human-kind,#br#
 so we decided to make some awesome biochemical weapons!"#pets100+30$$831$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
 %p% hasn't taken notice at your complete state of shock,#br#
 and keeps on telling their story.#br#
"Firstly, we must install an anti-gravity device,#br#
 and anyone can float in the air!"#pets100+30$$821$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"This Stoneray was the product of one our experiments,#br#
 but those pesky humans discovered our plans before we could improve them,#br#
 and we had no choice but to give them up."#br#
 %p% looks a bit upset at the failure of their plans.#pets100+30$$831$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
 %p% suddenly realizes that he may have said a tad too much.#br#
"SO! Anyway! I was just kidding about all of that.#br#
 I've NO clue how it's floating.#br#
 None at all."

"Stop standing around,#br#
 let's keep on working!"#br#
 %p% quickly rushes off,#br#
 with tools in their hands.#pets100+30$$831$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 After hearing this fantastical story,%p%
 you start to feel a bit less safe, but still oddly curious.#br#
 What exactly happened back then?#br#
 And more importantly, what kind of secrets are the Hoppalongs hiding?#char$$823$$0$0#|

"Twinkle twinkle little horn! Pretty soon it'll be like you were never worn!"#br#
 %p% approaches a Bladed Hornoceros in order to clean its horn.#pets100+30$$821$$0$0#

"Oh come on! Don't be such a little baby. You're a Bladed Hornoceros after all! It's fun!"#br#

 The Bladed Hornoceros continues rushing forward,#br#
 and is now headed straight at %p%.#pets100+30$$831$$0$0#

 You swear that %p% is brushing so hard that the horn is shrinking in size!#br#
 The Bladed Hornoceros moans in sheer agony. #M092010s30+20$Bladed Hornoceros$501$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
 As they're cleaning, %p% finds a small black dot on the horn,#br#
 and no matter how hard they brush, it doesn't seem to want to wash off.#br#
 %p% soon starts to viciously beat the black dot with the brush.#pets100+30$$30026$$0$0#

#&7$Bladed Hornoceros##br#
 The Bladed Hornoceros can no longer tolerate it anymore and flings %p% off with all of its might. #M092010s30+20$Bladed Hornoceros$2041$$1$0#

 You take the broken tooth, and dab a little glue on the end.#br#
 You ask %p% to open their mouth, press the tooth back into place,#br#

 called the Crystalline Cardinal. #M062010s40+10$Crystalline Cardinal$3$$1$0#

 Acting like your typical, up to no good wiseguy, he continues on,#br#
"Hey you! Little bird. let me teach you a thing or two.#br# 
 I'm the Hoppalong who can out eat twenty of the hungriest Hoppalongs.#br#

 Slightly ticked off, the Crystalline Cardinal spits on %p%, "Puh!"#br#
 and proceeds to wiggle its tushie at them just to annoy them.#br#
 It holds out a freshly baked cake,#br#
 and tells %p% to have it. #M062010s40+10$Crystalline Cardinal$4$$1$0#

"Hey! You're such a nuisance. How dare you spit on me?!#br#

 There weren't even any crumbs on the plate.#pets100+30$$831$$0$0#

 You and %p% decide to get to work on the Ranch very early,#br#
 mainly to fix the fence that was destroyed by the Ironskin Wyvern,#br#
 but the fence in such a state of disrepair that it's going to take a while.#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Ironskin Wyvern##br#
 The Ironskin Wyvern is happily munching on its fodder,#br#
 as you continue working hard on the fence.#br#
 Suddenly, it decided to walk over to %p%,#br#
 taps them on the shoulder, and says, "relax." #M063010s45+10$Ironskin Wyvern$1$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
 %p% starts pounding on the fence, at this point doing more harm than good,#br#
 when, all of a sudden, they stop, run over to the Ironskin Wyvern, and starts choking it.#pets100+30$$825$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"What? Relax? Really? Relax? Who do you think you are? Frankie?#br#
 This isn't Hollywood, we don't have that kinda money. You broke this fence,#br#
 and you're still all giddy?"#pets100+30$$831$$0$0#

#&7$Ironskin Wyvern##br#
 After being shamed, the Ironskin Wyvern feels a little guitly,#br#
 and decides to give the rest of its meal to %p%. #M063010s45+10$Ironskin Wyvern$4$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Honestly, I've never seen a more annoying Dragomon!#br#
 Do you even KNOW how annoying you are?#br#
 I mean, seriously!#br#
 SO annoying!!"#pets100+30$$831$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
 %p% shoves the Ironskin Wyvern's hands away angrily,#br#
 and kicks it right in the hindquarters.#pets100+30$$831$$0$0#

#&7$Ironskin Wyvern##br#
 The Ironskin Wyvern smiles dumbly in %p%'s direction. #M063010s45+10$Ironskin Wyvern$4$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Stop smiling! Go away! You think smiling is gonna fix this fence?#br#
 If you were really sorry, you'd be fixing it yourself!"#pets100+30$$831$$0$0#

#&7$Ironskin Wyvern##br#
 Having gotten the, not so subtle, hints, the Ironskin Wyvernpicks up the hammer and starts working on the fence.#br#
 Unfortunately, what once was a fixed fence, is not something that might have once resembled a fence. #M063010s45+10$Ironskin Wyvern$2041$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You and %p% look at the newly broken fence,#br#
 and both of your hearts sink to the ground.#char$$826$$0$0#|
3537|#&7$%n%##br#
 It's another lovely sunny day.#br#
 You and %p% are helping your poor Crocargot take a bath,#br#
 to clean all of the moss off its back.#char$$821$$0$0#

#&7$Omi##br#
 Omi suddenly shows up, holding a large kitchen knife in his hand.#br#
"I see you've already started the stew! This Crocargot sure looks tasty!#br#
 How much are you charging for it?#br#
 I want to create a special dish using your delicious Crocargot!" #M803010s100+30$Omi$821$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You and %p% are completely incensed,#br#
 and you push the Crocargot away from Omi.#br#
 You then turn to Omi and ask him to put the kitchen knife away.#char$$825$$0$0#

#&7$Omi##br#
"Come on! I've already been to the other Ranches,#br#
 and their Crocargot are all of poor quality! They're all either too skinny or just ill.#br#
 But %n%'s Crocargot looks like its in perfect shape!#br#
 It'll be delicious!" #M803010s100+30$Omi$831$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"No way! Nope. Just.. no! There's no way we're selling our Dragomon!#br#
 Every single one of our Dragomon was raised by me and %n% with love and care!#br#
 We have such a tight bond that we'll never part. Go away!"#pets100+30$$831$$0$0#

#&7$Omi##br#
 Not wanting to give up so quickly, Omi continues asking.#br#
"I'll give you my most expensive food coupon, if you want.#br#
 As long as you sell the Crocargot, I'll give ya anything!" #M803010s100+30$Omi$821$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 This is such a tempting offer that the two of you start to consider it.#br#
 Noticing your pause, the Crocargot starts to look a bit uneasy. #M074010s40+40$Crocargot$102$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
 Suddenly, you come up with an idea.#br#
You know, I just realized something, Omi.#br#
 I forgot to mention that our Crocargot is a legendary holy Dragomon.#br#
 If you cook it, its soul will take away one of the killer's skills!"#pets100+30$$823$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
What that means is, if you kill this Crocargot,#br#
 its soul might steal your ability to cook!#br#
 If ever want to cook again, I suggest you go looking elsewhere."#pets100+30$$826$$0$0#

#&7$Omi##br#
 Not wanting to lose his precious culinary abilities, Omi relents and heads back out. #M803010s100+30$Omi$827$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
 Seeing Omi disappear into the horizon, you let out a big sigh of relief.#br# Not that you're too proud of it, but it seems that you're getting better at lying.#br#
 You're surprised that Omi bought what you said. He's usually the one feeding  nonsense.#pets100+30$$824$$0$0#|
3538|#&7$%p%##br#
"What the... ?!" Shielded Styracosaur!! How come you look like an old man?!"#pets100+30$$825$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Oh no! What happened?!%n%! %n%!#br#
 This can't be! Shielded Styracosaur, are you from the future?" #M089010s40+20$Shielded Styracosaur$2$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You hear %p% crying out loud so you run over to the Ranch to see what's going on.#char$$301$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
 %p% sees you coming and points over to the Shielded Styracosaur,#br#
"%n%, have you seen that? What do we do? I wanted to feed the Shielded Styracosaur this morning,#br#
 but then I see this old guy hanging around. Is this Shielded Styracosaur from the future?"#pets100+30$$831$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You try to say something comforting to %p%,#br#
 but at the same time, you notice that the Shielded Styracosaur indeed has white fur and aging spots.#br#
 You try to find a reason for how it got so old so fast,#br#
 but you can't think of any logical reason.#char$$826$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 When %p% calls out to the Shielded Styracosaur, it responds right away. Is it really from the future? #M089010s40+20$Shielded Styracosaur$4$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"%n%, any ideas?#br#
 How do we send back this old guy and get back our young Shielded Styracosaur?"#pets100+30$$831$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You and %p% start to rack your brains trying to think of a possible solution.#br#
 From morning, to night, to the next day,#br#
 you can't think of any way to deal with this.#char$$826$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Suddenly, clouds roll and and you can hear the thunder in the distance.#br#
 The skies open up with rain, and you and %p% are soaked to the bone.#char$$823$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You and %p% rush over to coral all of the Dragomon, including the Shielded Styracosaur,#br#
 when you discover that the white fur and spots on the Shielded Styracosaur have started to run off,#br#
 and then completely disappear. #M089010s40+20$Shielded Styracosaur$1$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You and %p% look at each other and realize that#br#
 the reason the Shielded Styracosaur's looked like a senior citizen,#br#
 was because it had gotten into Omi's flour stores,#br#
 and it had gotten flour all over itself in the process.#char$$823$$1$0#|
3539|#&7$%n%##br#
 You hear %p% and a Dragomon chatting in the distance.#br#
 It sounds like they are mired in a heated debate.#char$$2$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"What?! I thought you were the king of blazing leos,#br#
 and you can't even lift up a lioness?#br#
 Are you even sure you're a proper lion?"#pets100+30$$831$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"If you were a REAL lion, then you'd be able to lift up a lioness.#br#
 You can't even manage that and you still call yourself the king of the blazing leos?#br#
 That's just absurd.#br#
 Blazing Leo? More like Extinguished Leo, amiright?"#pets100+30$$831$$1$0#

#&7$Blazing Leo##br#
 Clearly unhappy with %p%, the Blazing Leo roars angrily at them.#br#
 It even lunges at %p% in a fit of rage. #M099010s50+10$Blazing Leo$30005$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Honestly? Roaring at me isn't going to change anything.#br#
 I can lift up a Wingrus on my own,#br#
 and you can't even lift up a baby Dragomon!"#pets100+30$$826$$1$0#

#&7$Blazing Leo##br#
 The Blazing Leo roars louder than ever,#br#
 and tells %p% that he doesn't believe them.#br#
 He challenges %p% to a competition,#br#
 and asks %n% to be the referee. #M099010s50+10$Blazing Leo$30002$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 In order to improve the diversity of this manly contest, you invite lots of female Dragomon.#br#
 Baby Beakis, Faefly, Pebblepin, Fellswine,#br#
 and all types of female Dragomon are invited.#char$$821$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Let's get ready to compeeeeeete! In the first round, Blazing Leo and %p% both successfully lift a baby Beakis. #M099010s50+10$Blazing Leo$4$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 In round two, they both lift up the Faefly, but you can tell the Blazing Leo is struggling a bit.#br#
 On the other hand, %p% has no problem in lifting up the Faefly. #M099010s50+10$Blazing Leo$101$$0$0#

#&7$Blazing Leo##br#
 In the third round, they have to lift the Fellswine, but the Blazing Leo just can't handle it anymore.#br#
 No matter how hard he tries, he just can't manage to get the Fellswine off the ground. #M099010s50+10$Blazing Leo$101$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
 %p% sees this and bursts out in raucous laughter.#br#
"Oh dear me. You're such a weakling!#br#
 You can't even lift up a wee lil piggy? Oink oink oink!"#pets100+30$$821$$1$0#

#&7$Blazing Leo##br#
 The Blazing Leo looks incredibly man,#br#
 and is waiting to see if %p% can lift up the rotund Fellswine. #M099010s50+10$Blazing Leo$2$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Hahaha! You're SO lame.#br#
 Let me show you who's Mr. Olympia here.#br# 
 Check me out!#br#
 I only need to use one arm!"#pets100+30$$824$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You and the Blazing Leo look at each other in completely disbelief when you see %p% lift up the #br#.
 How could such a small Hoppalong lift up a Fellswine three times their size?#br#
 You're so shocked that you have to ask %p%.#char$$821$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"It's all thanks to you, %n%!#br#
 I always have to carry you back home when you fall asleep after a long day!"#pets100+30$$831$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 What the?#br#
 So you're the reason that %p% is so well trained!#char$$802$$0$0#|
3540|#&7$%n%##br#
 You and %p% are doing your daily chores on the Ranch,#br#
 when you arrive to the Crocargot's area,#br#
 you find a ton of candy strewn all over the floor.#char$$2$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 %p% is about to pick one up, but you snatch it before they can eat it,#br#
 and throw it across the room. Your Hoppalong is supposed to be on a diet!#char$$824$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Hey, man. That's not cool, I was gonna eat that! 
 What gives?  #pets100+30$$831$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You take all the candy, filling up several large bags, and #br#
 take it all to the Crocargot to ask what's going on. Why are they hoarding all that candy?#char$$803$$0$0#
 
#&7$Crocargot##br#
 The Crocargot seems to have no idea what you're talking about. #br#
 It seems to be telling the truth...#br#
 In fact it seems rather hurt that you'd accuse it of trying to fatten up your companion.#br# #M074010s30+20$Crocargot$53$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Together with %p%, you head back to the Ranch.#br#
 Weird, the Shielded Styracosaur's area is covered with candy too! What's going on?#char$$2$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Now you're starting to feel suspicious.#br#
 Styracosaurs usually hold to pretty strict dietary regimes.#br#
 It doesn't seem like them to eat candy. Something is afoot. You continue your investigation,#br#
 turning up candy in several other animal pens. Finally you come upon the Sabertooth Dragon.#char$$823$$0$0#

#&7$Sabertooth Dragon##br#
 The Sabertooth Dragon has its head buried in a giant bowl of food.#br#
 You call over to it several times but it seems not to hear you. #M055010s50+10$Sabertooth Dragon$1$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You wonder why it won't answer you. It's really chomping away at whatever's in that food bowl. #br#
 It must be something good. You're relieved when you approach to see it's a salad bowl. 
 Among all the Dragomon, apparently only the Sabertooth Dragon knows how to eat healthily.#br#
 You want to reward it so you ask %p% to give it some money.#char$$806$$0$0#

#&7$Sabertooth Dragon##br#
 Sabertooth Dragon continues to dig in to its salad, munching with gusto.#br#
 Wait a minute,#br#
 its cheeks have started to blush. And why is it laughing awkwardly?#br#
 And why does it smell like chocolate? What's going on here? #M055010s50+10$Sabertooth Dragon$4$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You and %p% snatch the salad bowl.#br#
 Inside, it's full to the brim with candy! 
 That sneaky Dragon!#br#
 No wonder he was eating so much salad! #M055010s50+10$Sabertooth Dragon$4$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 After careful interrogation, you find out that all the other candies scattered around the Ranch#br#
 was actually placed there by the Sabertooth Dragon himself, to set all the other Dragomon up!#char$$826$$0$0#

 when you sit, you must sit like a proper lady!"#pets100+30$$831$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Don't forget, you're going on a blind date tomorrow,#br#
 and you can't screw it up!"#br#
 Foxy Devil completely ignores %p% and sits all splayed out. #M104010s30+10$Foxy Devil$3$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
 %p% is clearly angered at this act of defiance and walks over to the Foxy Devil.#br#
 They pull the Foxy Devil's legs together, and slaps their back to make the sit up straight.#br#
 They even go so far as to put a book on their head to make sure they don't move.#pets100+30$$831$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"There we go! You look so much better now. Do you feel better? A proper lady!#br#
 I think you will look even better if you wear a skirt as well."#br#
 %p% continues teacher her about proper manners,#br#
 and how to behave on tomorrow's blind date.#pets100+30$$831$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 The next morning, you see %p% carrying a big bag,#br#
 and find out that they're looking for the Foxy Devil in the Ranch.#pets100+30$$302$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You follow %p% over,#br#
 and see them putting makeup on the Foxy Devil.#br#
 You smile at the sight and then go back to work.#char$$2$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
 Once %p% finished the Foxy Devil's makeup, they take her to the blind date.#pets100+30$$303$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"My dearest Foxy Devil,#br#
 I've given you the most fashionable makeup I could.#br#
 Your blind date is sure to fall in love with you at first sight!"#pets100+30$$824$$0$0#

#&7$Foxy Devil##br#
 %p%'s words make the Foxy Devil blush. She quietly awaits the arrival of her latest suitor.#br#
 Today will mark her 59th blind date,#br#
 and you sincerely hope that it's the last one. #M104010s30+10$Foxy Devil$2$$1$0#

#&7$Foxy Devil##br#
 When the Dragomon blind date shows up, Foxy Devil bashfully raises her hand to call him over.#br#
 Unfortunately, the blind date takes off in sheer horror at the very sight of her. #M099010s50+10$Blazing Leo$301$$0$0#

#&7$Foxy Devil##br#
 The Foxy Devil knows that she's a catch so something else must be wrong.
 She takes out a mirror to see that %p% completely messed up her makeup,#br#
 making her look like a Wingrus instead! #M058010s50+10$Winged Walrus$4$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
 The Foxy Devil is livid and takes off after %p%.#br#
 %p% seems to be completely at a loss of why she's so mad.#pets100+30$$825$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
 The run to you crying,#br#
Heeeeeeeeeelp meeee, %n%! Foxy Devil went crazy because the blind date went sour!"#pets100+30$$302$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You quickly wrangle the nearly uncontrollable Foxy Devil,#br#
 but you can't help but laugh out loud#br#
 at the sight of her face.#char$$804$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Now Foxy Devil's wild attack on %p% makes complete sense.#br#
 %p% Never did have a sense for aesthetics.#char$$804$$1$0#|

"How many more times do I need to tell you?#br#
 You need to stop leading guys on if you're not into them!"#pets100+30$$831$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Why do you keep doing this?#br#
 Why do you always play with their heads and then break their hearts?#br#
 Are you just showing off?"#pets100+30$$831$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
 %p% starts berating the Horrorbloom.#br#
 She pays no attention to them,#br#
 and just continues checking herself out in the mirror. #M109010s60-20$Horrorbloom$2$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"HEY! Hellllllooooooo. Are you even listening to me?#br#
 And who gave you that darn mirror?"#pets100+30$$831$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Do you know how many Dragomon you've dumped this week?#br#
 Honestly, if you keep on doing it,#br#
 I'll tear off all of your pretty little petals,#br#
 and then we'll see who wants to flirt with a bald flower."#pets100+30$$2111$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 When you the completely heartbroken look on the Horrorbloom's face,#br#
 you start to think that %p% may have gone a bit too far with that threat,#br#
 but at the same time, the Horrorbloom also needs to learn a lesson.#char$$826$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Look at this tiny Wingrus! He was like a 1000 lbs before,#br#
 but now?! He's only 400 lbs!!! It's all your fault!"#pets100+30$$831$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"And look at that Rhinosker! Notice anything missing?#br#
 That's right! He's almost bald now!#br#
 Just look around you. Heartbroken Dragomon everywhere!#br#
 Don't you feel any remorse?!"#pets100+30$$831$$0$0#

#&7$Horrorbloom##br#
 The Horrorbloom then leans over and whispers something to %p%,#br#
 which sets them off in a blind rage.#pets100+30$$825$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"SERIOUSLY?! You tell them that they're just friends?#br#
 How could you be so heartless?#br# 
 You're pure evil!"#pets100+30$$831$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
 %p% grabs a hold of Horrorbloom's stem and begins to shake it furiously.#br#
 The poor Horrorbloom's face turns to pure anguish as she watches her petals fall off.#br#
 Panicked, she tells %p% that she's sorry and she swears she won't do it again. #M109010s60-20$Horrorbloom$102$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Yeah, yeah, yeaaaah. If you ever do that again, I swear...#br#
 I promise you that I'll make Omi cook you a very, very special soup.#br#
 I think it's called the Mholt Special! Specially designed to make you go bald."#pets100+30$$831$$0$0#

#&7$Horrorbloom##br#
 The Horrorbloom is terrified at the mere thought of Omi's special soup,#br#
 and she continuously apologizes.#br#
 She promises %p% that she'll never flirt with anyone ever again! #M109010s60-20$Horrorbloom$102$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
 It seems that the Horrorbloom is truly remorseful for her treatment of the other Dragomon.#br#
 You and %p% then walk back to comfort the heartbroken Dragomon.#pets100+30$$831$$0$0#

 You and %p% are hard at work, clearing up Stegodile manure for later use as fertilizer.#br#
 Suddenly, over the hill comes a familiar figure, waving and grinning as they approach.#char$$3$$0$0#

#&7$Marvin##br#
"Hey, fellas! Wow, is that Stegodile manure? I've been looking everywhere for some of that. Can I get some off you guys?" #M812010s100+30$Marvin$831$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You and %p% exchange a suspicious look. Marvin can be so weird sometimes! No doubt he's on to some hare-brained moneymaking scheme... but it's not like there's a shortage#br#
 of poop, so you hand over a bucketful o' dung. A few days later, Marvin's back, asking for a refill.#br#
 And a few days later, again.#br#
 You and %p% start to wonder what's going on... Is poop-hoarding really a thing?#char$$821$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Marvin. Level with me here. What you gonna do with all that junk?#br#
 Are you painting a manural or what?" #pets100+30$$821$$1$0#

#&7$Marvin##br#
 Marvin starts stammering.#br#
"I... I... The p-...#br# It's just for fertilizer in my garden, okay?
 I gotta go. Toodles!"#br#
 In a flash, Marvin is off, grabbing yet another bucket of precious dung before you can stop him. #M812010s100+30$Marvin$302$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 A few days later, Marvin's back at the Ranch again, but this time it's not for manure.#br#
 Instead, he's come bearing a gift-- Two pieces of cake to share with you and %p%.#char$$821$$1$0#

#&7$Marvin##br#
"Hey guys! I just wanted to thank you for sharing your Stegodile poo-poo, with me, so I've  #br#
 brought two pieces of cake to share with you guys! Let me know how you like them! #br# #M812010s100+30$Marvin$831$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You and %p% happily tuck in to the cakes Marvin brought,#br#
 and compare the taste.#br#
 They each look slightly different, but they both taste exactly the same.#char$$2$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Thanks for the cake Marvin! They're both good!#br#
 What recipes did you use? Not one of Omi's?#br#

#&7$Marvin##br#
"Yay! I finally made it! This is gonna be my golden ticket! I'll be rich!"#br#
 You and %p% exchange confused looks. You have no idea why Marvin is so excited. #M812010s100+30$Marvin$824$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Marvin winks at you and says that he's worked up a special refinement technique-#br#
 one of the cakes was made from oil extracted from the Stegodile dung you gave him.#char$$825$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 This news comes as quite the shock. You and %p% immediately start gagging and retching,#br#
 spitting out poopy cake all over the ground, tears streaming down your wretched faces.

#&7$%p%##br#
"Marvin! This time, you've gone too far!#br# As if Omi's food isn't bad enough, now you're giving us the Pu-pu Platter?
 Are you out of your mind?#br#
 Do you want us to get worms? Take your craptacular cake and get out!"#pets100+30$$2111$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Holding him down, you and %p% throw the rest of the cake over Marvin's head, #br#
 and force him to fork over all the money he's earned from his oil enterprise.#br#
 You'll have to return it to his unwitting investors,#br#
 before they realize what sort of operation they've signed up for.

 You hear %p% screaming from faraway.#br#
Maaaaaaaaaaarvin!! Nooooooooooo, don't do it!#pets100+30$$101$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 What's going on now? Never a dull moment when Marvin's around...#char$$826$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Marvin seems excited,#br#
 staring with wonder at the diamond on the Dracofowl's head. #M118010s45+10$Dracofowl$1$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You notice %p% standing next to Marvin as well. They seem to be in some distress.#pets100+30$$104$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
 %p% holds Marvin's legs very tightly, trying to stop him.#br#
"Oh no you don't! You greedy swine! Get it out of your head!#br#
 That's my friend. I'll never let you touch her. She's not for sale! Not for a million coins!#br#
    #pets100+30$$104$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 What's %p% playing at?#br#
 They look pretty silly, hanging on to Marvin's legs like a baby koala.#br#
 You decide to keep watching to see how it plays out.#char$$823$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You take a seat to watch how the scene unfolds.#br#
 Knowing %p% and Marvin, it'll probably be quite the drama. #char$$821$$1$0#

#&7$Marvin##br#
 Marvin finally extricates himself from %p%'s koala snare, and rushes up to the Dracofowl's fence. He stares at the diamond, greedily licking his lips, and muttering.#br#
"She will be mine! Oh yes! She will be mine! Name your price kid. I'll pay anything you say." #M812010s100+30$Marvin$821$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
 %p% is very upset at Marvin, but knows that once he gets started, it's#br#
 very hard to get him to drop an idea. They try changing the subject,#br#
 telling stories of other diamonds in an attempt to get Marvin to forget about the Dracofowl.

#&7$%p%##br#
"Have you ever heard of the Fugazi Diamond? It's amazing, I tell you!#br#
 Way better than a dumb bird's stone. If you rub it, the Fugazi can grant you magic powers!"#br#
 %p% says, leading Marvin away from the fence.#pets100+30$$821$$0$0#

#&7$Marvin##br#
 Marvin stares at %p% for a long moment. You're not sure whether he's taken the bait or not.#br# #M812010s100+30$Marvin$1$$1$0#

#&7$Marvin##br#
 Finally, he brightens up. With sparkling eyes, he answers %p% excitedly. #br#
"Is that true? I want it! I need it! So long, suckers, I'm off to get paid!" #M812010s100+30$Marvin$831$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
 %p% nods.#br#
"I'd never lie to you, Marvin. Of course it's true! Hey, wait!"#pets100+30$$831$$0$0#

#&7$Marvin##br#
 Marvin has already run away to find the diamond before anyone else can get to it. #M812010s100+30$Marvin$303$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You walk up to %p%, and tell him that you saw the whole conversation.#br#
 You are very curious about the Fugazi Diamond. Could such a miraculous thing actually exist?#char$$821$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
 %p% scratches their head and chuckles,#br#
"A magic diamond? No way, I just made that up. Can't believe Marvin fell for it!#br# What a dope! Well, that'll teach him for that dirty trick with the statue!"#br#
 You and %p% look at each other and burst out laughing.#pets100+30$$821$$0$0#|
3545|#&7$%p%##br#
"Aloha! Shake shake shake! Shake that butt!#br#
 %n%! Check it out! I got my new Hoppalong feather kilt!#br#
 It's made of 100% humanely collected Hawkagon feathers!#br#
 Stylish, eco-friendly, and dare I say it, accents me in all the right places. Yowza!#pets100+30$$824$$0$0#

#&7$Hawkagon##br#
 %p% seems really happy. You're happy to see that %p% has made a new friend,#br#
 even if their choice of attire is a bit flashy for your taste. #M117010s50+10$Hawkagon$1$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br# 
"It's said that Hawkagon feathers bring good luck. I had such a lucky day today! It makes me wanna Hula dance!"#br#
 %p% continues dancing.#pets100+30$$824$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You ask what happened that was so great.#char$$821$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"First, Omi asked me to try his special meal, but he accidentally knocked over the plate. #br#
 After that, Michaela made Marvin give me a special offer at his shop, (hence this awesome kilt).#br#
 And finally, when Louis was crying and wouldn't be quiet, Agatha just carried him away."#br#
 %p% says that all you need to do to change your luck is grab a feather and frown.#pets100+30$$821$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You want to give it a try, so you ask %p% to lend you a feather.#br#
 You head out to see how you fare with your new insta-luck charm.#char$$4$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 First, you head to the Hunters' League and meet Angel. You immediately frown.#br#
 Instantly, a Hoppalong jumps out from behind Angel. Oh! It's Doreen!#br#
 Doreen looks at you, expectantly waiting for you to share some adventure stories. #M815010s100+30$Doreen$821$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You frown harder, but she just looks at you weird, so you quickly make an excuse#br# and beat a hurried retreat.
  #char$$821$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Next, you come upon a lost hunter, wandering forlornly and aimlessly around.#br#
 You quickly run over and ask if everything's okay, showing a big frown as you do so. #M301010$Hunter$826$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Turns out the hunter is actually a beginner, so you teach him a few tricks of the trade.#br#
 The Hunter then gives you a coupon as a gift to thank you.#char$$821$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Wow -- it's actually a lottery coupon! You immediately head to the Vendor.#char$$806$$1$0#

#&7$Vendor Staff##br#
"Congratulations!"#M307010$Vendor Staff$4$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You wonder what you've won. Could your lucky feather have really just won you the lottery?#char$$1$$1$0#

#&7$Vendor Staff##br#
"Your prize is... a bottle of potion!" #M307010$Vendor Staff$822$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Eh...It's the not the best prize, but at least it's something.#br#
 Maybe you need to frown harder next time.#br#
 You practice frowning all the way home. Several little kids cry, but you don't feel bad.#char$$806$$1$0#|
3546|#&7$Rockmane Raptor##br#
 Rockmane Raptor is happily digging into the specially prepared meal that %p% cooked. #M047010s50+10$Rockmane Raptor$503$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
 %p% seems to be lost in thought.#pets100+30$$1$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"If our lovely Rockmane Raptor would only dress up a little bit, he could be on a magazine cover!#br#
 Trendiest Dragomon of the year!"#br#
 %p% checks out the Rockmane Raptor from head to toe.#pets100+30$$821$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 %p% is so weird sometimes.
 What is that funny bunny planning?#char$$810$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
 %p% suddenly claps their paws.#br#
"Alright! Let's do this! You just wait here, dearies! %p% will be back in a jiffy. "#br#
 %p%, humming a melody, bounces over to the warehouse.#pets100+30$$824$$1$0#

#&7$Rockmane Raptor##br#
 Strange sounds emerge from the warehouse.#br#
 The Rockmane Raptor, sensing that something is wrong, stops eating.#br#
 He stares over at the warehouse, a piece of meat still hanging from his gaping jaws. #M047010s50+10$Rockmane Raptor$1$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
 %p% rushes out from the warehouse with a trolly, tripping over their feet in excitement.#br#
"I'm back, duckies! Have you missed me? No matter. Look at what %p%'s brought you.#br# The Hoppalong makeup kit! For Hoppalonger lashes, Hoppalicious lobes, and Hoppaluscious lips!#br#
 It's also got the brushybrush, the claw thing, a drill, a sweet chain, a tranquilizer gun...#br#
 what's that in here for? No matter, it's a great set! #pets100+30$$821$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Sounds like a pretty weird makeup set.#br#
 You ask %p% what they are planning to do with it.#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"%n%! Don't you know there's a Dragomon beauty competition this month?#br#
 Don't you think our Rockmane Raptor could be the champion?"#br#
 %p% shows you an old celebrity picture,#br#
 of a Dragomon with exactly same hair style as you Rockmane Raptor.#pets100+30$$831$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You have to admit, it looks pretty good with that Pompadour.

#&7$%p%##br#
"First of all, let's do some skin peeling for ya!"#br#
 %p% grabs the brushybrush and peels away at Rockmane Raptor's skin with gusto.#br#
 Rock shavings fly everywhere, but the creature seems okay with the process. Its rocklike skin must be impervious to the brushing. #M047010s50+10$Rockmane Raptor$203$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 %p% is really going at it, holding that brushybrush as if its a Battleaxe.#pets100+30$$2021$$1$0#

#&7$Rockmane Raptor##br#
 Now %p% is messing about with Rockmane Raptor's hair, as if its a Barbie doll. But still the Raptor doesn't react! #M047010s50+10$Rockmane Raptor$1$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
 Now %p% grabs the chain and starts leading the Raptor around in circles. It seems super tame.#br#
"Good. You see? Our Raptor is the best! We'll definitely win the competition! I know it! #br#
 Now finally! The last step. Let's finish your hair!"#pets100+30$$822$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
 %p% picks up the electric drill and drills a rock on the ground to give it a test.#br#
 The rock immediately shatters into tiny fragments.#pets100+30$$2121$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Whoa, okay, cool. Wasn't expecting that. But that's okay, this'll look great on you! Trust me!#br# Okay- hold still. This may sting a little."
 %p% advances towards the Raptor, holding the drill with a crazy look. You gulp nervously.#pets100+30$$824$$1$0#

#&7$Rockmane Raptor##br#
 Now, however, the Rockmane Raptor is frightened, moaning and shaking its head in terror.#br#
 With a roar, it leaps over %p%'s head, bounding quickly out of reach. #M047010s50+10$Rockmane Raptor$301$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Hey, wait! Don't run off!! Come back!#br#
 "What about the competition?"#pets100+30$$303$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You and %p% look at the half made-up, Raptor, who suddenly sneezes, sending #br#
 clouds of makeup everywhere. You both break into guffaws. It was all worth it, just for that.|
3547|#&7$%p%##br#
"Primal Strigida! How much food do you eat a day?" #br#
 %p% has brought lots of food but it's never enough for the ever voracious Strigida. #pets100+30$$831$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
 %p% walks toward to you, looking tired and frustrated. #br#
"That Primal Strigida...everytime I see him, he's always eating!  He's gonna get fat!#br#
 He's supposedly an owl, but I've never seen him fly, or do anything other than eat." #char$$1$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
 %p% actually seems pretty worried, so you try to calm them down. #br#
"Once, Primal Owl leaped over that tree and fell to the ground. #br#
 It couldn't even fly, just roll along the ground. He didn't stop rolling until I stopped him. #br#
 How could I not worry about a creature like that?"#br# He's an owl, he's supposed to be flying in the sky! But he acts more like a bowling ball."#pets100+30$$821$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You remember the rolling incident. It definitely wasn't the finest moment in#br#
 the history of Strigidom. 

#&7$%p%##br#
 You and %p% decide to make Primal Owl work out a bit to get into shape. #br#
"Okay, Stridgie, this is a tool that Omi needs. Please deliver it to him. #br#
 If you can't make it, no dinner tonight." #pets100+30$$831$$0$0#

#&7$Primal Owl##br# 
 "What? No dinner? That's a hoot." #br#
 Primal Strigida immediately tells %p% he'll do it. #br#
 Omi will have his tool delivered post-haste!  #M066010s50+10$Primal Strigida$3$$1$0#

#&7$Primal Owl##br# 
 After a while, the bird returns with with a small paper tied to one foot. #br#
 It's a note from Omi, saying he needs some other tools as well#br#
 It promises a special reward for a successful redelivery.  #M066010s50+10$Primal Strigida$4$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Primal Strigida! You're doing very well! But... we need you to deliver something again. #br#
 On the plus side, Omi will give us something in return.#br# Isn't that exciting?
 %p% ties the package onto the Primal Strigida's foot and pats his head. #pets100+30$$822$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 It's already dinner time, but the Primal Strigida is still missing.#char$$1$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"It's Primal Strigida! He's finally back! But... he looks kinda weird!"#br#
 The lost-looking Primal Strigida slowly lands beside %p%. He looks ready to collapse.#br#
 There's another note from Omi attached to his foot! #M066010s50+10$Primal Strigida$2$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
 %p% quickly unfolds the paper to see what the latest message says. #br#
"Thanks everyone! I've made some new dishes for you guys to say thanks! Please share and bon appetit!" #pets100+30$$831$$0$0#

#&7$Primal Owl##br#
 You can't find any food on the Primal Owl, but it has a haunted look on its face.#br#
 So you can guess what might have happened.#br# Primal Strigida must have finished Omi's dish. #M066010s50+10$Primal Strigida$4$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You feel sorry for Primal Strigida, but it has learned a valuable lesson. And now it'll probably #br#
 lose some weight! You and %p% both sigh in admiration of Omi's special talent. #char$$826$$1$0#|
3548|#&7$%p%##br#
"Why don't you love me? #br#
 I don't have a mount, I don't have a six-pack, I don't have endless cash, #br#
 but at least I have a sincere heart!" #br#
 %p% is reading a novel and grinding their teeth in anger. #pets100+30$$825$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Why do all the girls only like bad Hoppalongs? #br#
 It's not fair!"
 %p% looks at you dejectedly, waiting for your response. #char$$1$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You ask %p% to imagine sitting in a shopping cart. Would they want someone to violently push the cart around and crash it into things?#br#
 Of course not! %p% agrees with you wholeheartedly.

#&7$%n%##br#
 You continue, asking %p%, #br#
 who they prefer, always angry Agatha or lovable Delphia? #br#
 %p% first shudders, then smiles. The answer is obvious. #char$$821$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You continue, posing a third question. #br#
 What if you took %p% out for a meal and you paid for everything, #br#
 would %p% think that was fair, or would they offer to pay? #char$$821$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
 %p% replies that they'd love that, and asks what time to be ready.#pets100+30$$824$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You bash %p%'s head with the novel. They've totally missed the point!#br#
 %p% immediately bursts into tears. #char$$4$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
 But %p% seems to have caught your drift, #br#
 and walks over to Hybrid Harrier. #M061010s35+20$Hybrid Harrier$1$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"I may not be rich, but at least I can still have fun!#br# Let's go on a ride. #br#
 Come on, let's go! Fly!"   

#&7$Hybrid Harrier##br#
 Hybrid Harrier looks at you, waiting for a signal. #M061010s35+20$Hybrid Harrier$2$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You nod to Hybrid Harrier to let it fly %p% around for a while.#char$$806$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Wheeeeeeeeee! Hahahaha! I'm flying! Yayyyyyyyyy!"#pets100+30$$824$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You hear %p%'s whoops and laughter from above, #br#
 and wonder if maybe they've had a few too many sugary treats today...#br#
 But at least they're having a good time. Hopefully this flight will let them let off a bit of steam.#char$$826$$1$0#|
3549|#&7$%p%##br#
"Dig... dig...  dig deeper!"#pets100+30$$1$$0$0#

#&7$Toothy Ornithor##br#
 Ever since %p% got a treasure map from Marvin, #br#
 they've been taking Toothy Ornithor out for daily rides to dig and search for treasure. #M054010s50+10$Toothy Ornithor$4$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Your gut says the map must be a fake, or Marvin would have never given it away for free.#char$$826$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 or maybe it's some kind of prank. Either way, you don't trust it.#br# You must stop %p%, before they dig up the whole Ranch on their#br#
 crazy treasure hunt. You approach them with an offer to help search- #br#
 you can split any profits fifty-fifty. #char$$821$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
 %p% thinks it over.#br#
 Finally, they nod their approval and you shake on the deal.
 #pets100+30$$822$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 While %p% is busy digging, you throw a random wooden box into a different#br#
 pit and cry out that you've found something.#char$$821$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
 %p% is excited and jumps into the pit, tearing open the "treasure chest".#br#
"There are seven crystal beads inside! Each of them is inscribed with a different number! #br#
 Oh! How exciting! And there are some words on top of the box!"#pets100+30$$824$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"You can make three wishes with seven crystal beads..."#br#
 %p% seems to think this sounds somehow familiar.#pets100+30$$2$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Before they can recall where the beads came from. you interrupt %p%,#br#
 and say that they'd better make the wishes now before they expire.#char$$4$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Okay! Here we go! Dear crystal beads.... I want to make a wish!"#pets100+30$$822$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You try throwing your voice to pretend that you're the crystal bead, #br#
 and reply to %p%, saying you are the Ancient and Venerable Bead,#br#
 and that you will grant three wishes.#char$$821$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
 %p% is very excited at this. They stare at the beads in delight. #br#
"Okay! My first wish is that I want %n% to brush and massage my fur every day.#br#
 No- twice a day! And...."#pets100+30$$1$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"And....Ouch!"#br#
 Before %p% can continue, you chuck a small stone at their ear for making such a cheeky wish.#pets100+30$$1$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
  You tell %p%, that they only have two wishes left.#char$$825$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
 %p% rubs their sore ear,#br#
 looks at the crystal beads, and thinks carefully about the second wish.#pets100+30$$826$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
 %p%thinks for a long time before finally settling on a wish. Finally they continue. #br#
"My second wish is to get more snacks from %n%.#br#
 I don't understand why should I have to share my snacks with other people..."#pets100+30$$831$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
 %p% starts to complain.#br#
 You throw another small stone at %p%'s ear to get them to shut up.#br#
"Alright! I know, it's a selfish wish, but it's what I want.#br# And my last wish is...

#&7$%p%##br#
 This time,%p% doesn't need much time to think before wishing.#br#
"I wish for %n% to always be safe in hunts and battles.#br#
 I don't ever want to lose them!"

#&7$%n%##br#
 You're touched but you have a feeling %p%'s being overly melodramatic so you interrupt them.#br#
 You let a ladder down into the pit so that %p% can climb up.#char$$806$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 %p% looks a bit sheepish, but happy all the same. What a cute, bizarre little dude. #br#
 You brush %p%'s fur and go buy some more of their favorite snacks. Wishes can come true!#char$$821$$0$0#|
3550|#&7$%p%##br#
"Ha! Hoo!"#br#
 %p% shakes their tiny fist in the air. #pets100+30$$2101$$0$0#

#&7$Primal Frosthare##br#
 Primal Frosthare does the same. #M094010s50+10$Primal Frosthare$2011$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You ask %p% what all the fuss is about. #br#
 Looks like they're trying to train Frosty to be a combat mount?#char$$4$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"As a Hoppalong, I find it hard to find a mount. #br#
 But if the mount is a Primal Frosthare, problem solved! It's the power of rabbit - squared!#br#
 %p% wants to show you what they've been practicing.#pets100+30$$821$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
 %p% leads the Primal Frosthare forward a few paces. #br#
 Wow, that's some impressive training. %p% looks like a boss! #M094010s50+10$Primal Frosthare$1$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Step one. Two-Bunny Punch!
 %p% looks so confident.#pets100+30$$831$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Lean over a bit! A bit more! I can't reach the top of your head!"#br#
 %p% is too short, so he has to hop to get onto the Frosthare's back.#br#
 But now, in front of an audience,%p% seems to be too nervous and fudges the landing.#pets100+30$$30005$$0$0#

#&7$Primal Frosthare##br#
"Oops! Oh, no..." %p%'s managed to scratch the Frosthare during#br# that missed jump—now it's run away! It seems like it's really hurt!
   #M094010s50+10$Primal Frosthare$301$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
 Now what's %p% doing? They're trying another flying landing with a longer runup...#pets100+30$$601$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Jeez, %p%'s performance seems to be going from bad to worse.#br#
 This time, they've completely missed the Hare's back, and landed face first in a ditch.#br#
 Seems like the Two-Bunny Punch still needs some work.

#&7$%n%##br#
 You step over to help %p% back up to their feet. #br#
 %p% brushes themselves off and thanks you, a little sheepishly.#br#
 You tell %p% not to give up. It's never too late to try again. #char$$821$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
 %p% hops back on to the Primal Frosthare's head again, #br#
 this time holding on to its two ears tightly.#pets100+30$$602$$0$0#

#&7$Primal Frosthare##br#
 That's more like it! Now %p% is guiding the Primal Frosthare around,#br#
 using its ears like reins to indicate which direction to go. #M094010s50+10$Primal Frosthare$2$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Hehe. See this? #br#
 Told you we have a connection!
 We're the best rabbit team in history. #br#
 Check this out! Bunny Punch! Hare Stare! Jumpin' Judo Kick!

#&7$%n%##br#
 %p% is really enjoying themselves now, zooming around #br# with their mount, going faster and faster, reaching dangerous speeds.#br#
 #char$$826$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
 Finally, with a drawn out scream, #br#
 %p% is flung off. You see them sail off, landing in a heap in some tall grass. #br#
 They're still clutching a tuft of rabbit fur. The Primal Frosthare has a big bare #br#
 patch on its back. It seems to have fainted from too much running.

#&7$Primal Frosthare##br#
 Finally, the hare struggles to its feet. #br#
 %p%, feeling bad, tries to go comfort it, but it bounds away fearfully.#br#
 Seems like it's got some PTSD issues now with %p%. #M094010s50+30$Primal Frosthare$504$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"%n%, I think I hurt Primal Frosthare.#br# I keep trying to tell it that being bald is not so bad.#br#
 But it won't even let me near it anymore.

#&7$%n%##br#
 You tell %p% that maybe they ought to leave that poor hare alone.#br#
 It's clearly traumatized. Wasn't one Mholt enough? Now you have two.|
3551|#&7$%p%##br#
 %p% hops up to you excitedly. #br#
"%n%,%n%, have you ever heard about the earth oven?"#pets100+30$$821$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You say you haven't. #char$$4$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"It's awesome! It's like this cute little mound that is burnt with firewood. #br#
 You can put food in it, and steam it, or bake or whatever! Isn't that cool?",#br#
 Says %p%, excitedly.#pets100+30$$821$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 After listening to %p%'s explanation, you agree to give it a try.#br#
 You look around the Ranch for the best place to put your lil oven. #br#
 Soon, you settle on a small hill in the corner of the Ranch that seems like a good spot.#char$$806$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Following %p%'s instructions, you pile up a small mound of earth and light it with firewood.#br#
 Uh oh. It seems that the little mound wasn't built properly. Did it just move?#br#
 You ask %p% if this normal for earth ovens.#char$$821$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Really? It moved? I didn't see anything! It was probably nothing!"#br#
 %p% is too excited about the earth oven to stop and check if it's okay.#pets100+30$$831$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
 As soon as the firewood starts glowing red, you put the food you've brought into the mound.#br#
 %p% is so excited they start dancing around the mound.#br#
"This is gonna be so amazing and yummy! I can't wait!"#pets100+30$$824$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Suddenly the mound moves again. This time, you're certain you saw something.#char$$821$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"It's nothing! Probably just the delicious food bubbling away!#br# It's gonna be ready so soon!
 Yay, I can even smell it!#br# Earth oven! Earth oven! La la la la la...."  
 %p% continues to sing and dance around the oven.#pets100+30$$824$$0$0#

#&7$Glacial Tyrant##br#
 Suddenly, the mound seems to be swallowed into the ground. With a violent roar,#br#
 the hill itself seems to rise up into the air, to reveal...#br#
 The earth oven was built on the back of the Glacial Tyrant! The fire was so hot you woke it up! #M050010s50+10$Glacial Tyrant$4$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Ahhhhhhhhh! Oh my god! Our food!"#br#
 %p% screams loudly, dodging the burning wood and peat that is flying everywhere. #pets100+30$$823$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 After making sure you're both okay, you and %p% go tend to the Glacial Tyrant to see #br#
 how it's doing. 

#&7$%p%##br#
"Oh my goodness! I can't believe we almost cooked the Glacial Tyrant too! But this earth oven is really awesome.#br#
 We need to try it again sometime real soon! Let's invite everyone to join us next time!"#br#
 You nod at %p%, but all you can think about now is #br# how now you'll need to find something else to eat for dinner... pizza again?
 #pets100+30$$821$$0$0#|
3552|#&7$%p%##br#
"Hey, %n%, have you ever seen a crocodile before?"#pets100+30$$821$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 %p% implores of you.#char$$4$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"I've heard that crocodiles have REALLY hard skin. It's so hard that even knives or bullets can't penetrate it!#br#
 Do you think that's possible?! I'm not really sure if I believe it myself."#pets100+30$$831$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
 %p% looks over to the Crocosaur who is minding its own business beside them. #M086010s40+30$Crocosaur$1$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"You know what I've also heard?! I've heard that Crocosaur and crocodiles belong to the same species!#br# You know... what if...
 Ha! I'm such a genius.  Just wait and see."#br#
 %p% has the aura of someone who's planning on something devious.#pets100+30$$824$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
 %p% sneaks up to the Crocosaur who's fallen asleep.#br#
"If what they say is true about the Crocosaur's skin, let's see what happens."#pets100+30$$831$$0$0#

#&7$Crocosaur##br#
 %p% picks up a steel scrubber and starts to watch the Crocosaur.#br#
 Surprisingly, the Crocosaur seems to enjoy this unannounced bathing session. #M086010s40+30$Crocosaur$4$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
 %p% pauses for a second, looks at the spikes on the Crocosaur's back,#br#
 then rushes over to the storage room.#pets100+30$$303$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
 After some time, %p% finally comes out with a durian and some chestnuts.#br#
"From doooownTOOOOWN!"#br#
 The durian goes flying through the air, in the direction of the Crocosaur.#pets100+30$$821$$0$0#

#&7$Crocosaur##br#
 Amazingly, the Crocosaur arches its back, and perfectly slices the durian in half.#br#
 %p% and Crocosaur high five each other and do some sort of weird pre-planned celebration. #M086010s40+30$Crocosaur$4$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Seems like we've got our own Jordan and Pippen over here.#br#
 You're not quite sure if things could get any weirder around here.#char$$806$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"The show has just begun! Lllllllladies and gentlemon! May you direct your attention to me! Now check this."#br#
 %p% places the chestnuts on top of Crocosaur's head and yells as if he were a merchant.#pets100+30$$821$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"These chestnuts stand no chance against my mighty powers!"#pets100+30$$822$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 %p% pulls out a huge hammer out of nowhere.#br#
 There's no way he just normally walks around with that thing on a daily basis.#char$$823$$1$0#

#&7$Crocosaur##br#
 %p% winds up and slams the hammer down onto the chestnuts,#br#
 the chestnuts instantly crumble, but so does the Crocosaur, who's now turned into a floating spirit with a halo above its head. #M086010s40+30$Crocosaur$501$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You're completely astounded at what just transpired, but you decide to use it as a learning experience.#br#
 It doesn't matter how good someone's defense is, there's no possible way to dodge a hammer blow at close range.#br#
 From now on, you'll be sure to pack a hammer when you go hunting for Dragomon.#char$$823$$0$0#|
3553|#&7$%p%##br#
"Eyedim Dragon, come eat your food!"#br#
 %p% yell over to the Eyedim Dragon who's standing by the fence.#pets100+30$$821$$0$0#

#&7$Eyedim Dragon##br#
 The Eyedim Dragon was born with a spectacular sense of hearing and smell.#br#
 Although it's blind, it still managed to come running after you and %p% every day. #M057010s35+20$Eyedim Dragon$4$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You decide that you want to see how well the Eyedim Dragon can sense everyone,#br#
 and you decide to play hide and seek together.#br#
 %p% says that they want to be the seeker but you interrupt to say that the Eyedim Dragon should go first.#br# Let's add a twist to it! Whoever gets caught has to do whatever it says for the whole year!#char$$821$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 The added pressure has %p% feeling nervous about being caught,#br#
 but they're also excited by the thrill of the hunt!#br#
 You laugh at the tortured expression on their face, and you secretly take out a little bag of vanilla powder.

#&7$%p%##br#
"So we'll go at the count of 10, okay?"#br#
 You sneakily sprinkle some vanilla powder on %p%'s fluffy tail.#pets100+30$$831$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Hey, do you smell that? *sniff sniff*#br#
 I swear I have a vanilla cupcake following me around since we started playing.#br#
 Normally I'd complain but it smells SOOOO good! It's so pleasant!"#br#
 %p% wafts the air into their nose. You shrug and simply state that you can't smell anything.#pets100+30$$821$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You lay down on the grass and stay as still as possible as the Eyedim Dragon walks past you.#br#
 It doesn't seem to sense your presence. Luckily.#br#
 Suddenly, you see the Eyedim Dragon perk up as it catches a scent of vanilla.#br#
 It gives its butt a little wiggle, rears back, springs into the bush, and clamps onto %p%'s tail with its mouth. #M057010s35+20$Eyedim Dragon$4$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"ARGH. Owwwie! What the heeeeeeey!"#br#
 %p% cries out in pain.#br#
 The Eyedim Dragon looks so satisfied that it doesn't want to release %p%'s tail.#pets100+30$$824$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You tell %p% that they've officially lost the game with a smug look on your face.#br#
 It's about time that %p% goes to buy some snacks for afternoon tea anyway.#br#
 You're happy that you won. Then again, you had a feeling you would.#char$$821$$0$0#|
3554|Prepare to die!|
3555|It's over...|
3556|Wh-... what?!|
3557|No! It's... absorbing the power of the nearby crystals!|
3558|Nngh!!|
3559|Get her out of there!|
3560|On it!|
3561|Stop being such a baby and just surrender already!|
3562|Wh-what?!|
3563|You think I'm gonna just stand here and let you attack my men?!|
3564|Die, you repulsive sack of excrement!!|
3565|I don't think you understand what I'm saying.|
3566|You mean you WANT Lenora to hate you?!|
3567|What? No, I-... I didn't mean it like that! No one understaaands...|
3568|You just asked how to make Lenora treat you like Agatha treats ME!|
3569|How else am I supposed to take that?!|
3570|I, well, I mean... don't you...? Hmm...|
3571|Well, you have always been a bit of a clod. A charming one, don't get me wrong!|
3572|What the BLAZES are you going on about?!|
3573|You mean you really don't know?|
3574|H-hey! Who's there?!|
3575|I-... I didn't-... I wasn't-...!!|
3576|Y-Y-YOU?!|
3577|GUUURRAAOOR!!|
3578|Le... Lenora?|
3579|N-no...|
3580|GUUURRAAOOR!!|
3581|Thank you, Lenora...|
3582|Goodbye, my dearest friend... Farewell...|
3583|I will never forget...|
3584|Those precious, precious memories...|
3585|The good days... and the bad...|
3586|You were... my best friend...|
3587|Phew! Look at all this RUST!|
3588|This contraption must be centuries old!|
3589|HEY!|
3590|Pay attention when I'm talking to you! You're supposed to be assisting me!|
3591|So aSSIST me in investigating the area!|
3592|Huh? What in blazes is that?!|
3593|Looks like some kind of rare ore! Money, money, money!|
3594|Y-Y-YIKES!|
3595|What's a Dragomon doing here?!|
3596|Be careful! I'll deal with this!|
3597|I've got it trapped! Now's your chance—take it out!|
3598|We have an audience again, it seems.|
3599|Don't turn your back on me!|
3600|So, so naïve...|
3601|You're just in time, humans. Time to witness the birth of a new era!|
3602|Great Dragon Queen of Shadow, your time draws near!|
3603|My... my body feels... so hot...|
3604|So the seal has finally gotten to you. And here I thought you were stronger than that...|
3605|No matter. The humans need a playmate. Or was it the other way around? Heheh...|
3606|Don't let him get away!|
3607|Think again, little birdies!|
3608|Wonderful. Just who I was hoping to see again!|
3609|What the hell are you doing helping these murdering scum?!|
3610|Don't you care at ALL about your own home?|
3611|Aw, shut that overworked trap of yours, Pelt!|
3612|You don't even know what you're talking about!|
3613|'Tis nothing more than a simple business exchange, after all.|
3614|Blind, blind little sheep...|
3615|Hanging on every word that holy queen of yours shoves down your ears.|
3616|o-... of course, you haven't!|
3617|Katya!|
3618|You haven't forgotten me, have you? Your own sister?|
3619|Heh. And here I thought YOU'D forgotten ME.|
3620|Why would you leave us? Why would you leave ME?|
3621|I don't have time to explain, Ukyo.|
3622|The moment has come!|
3623|Retreat, men!|
3624|I... can't... control...|
3625|Seems Fire Dragon royalty are dropping like flies these days...|
3626|She needs immediate medical attention. Nash, can you get us out of here?|
3627|No sooner said than done!|
3628|Nothing to report!|
3629|Shut up, shut up, shut UP!|
3630|Are you even listening to yourself?!|
3631|Someday... SOMEday you'll understand, Oriel.|
3632|You'll understand just what humans actually are!|
3633|Maybe then you'll wish you'd listened to me!|
3634|Let the Shadow Dragon Army come. Let them ALL come!|
3635|I'll handle it myself, just as I've always done!|
3636|B-but...!|
3637|Put a cork in it!|
3638|I'm done talking. I'm the queen around here, and I'LL make the decisions!|
3639|As much as I hate to interrupt...|
3640|The good queen has something that I just so happen to need.|
3641|And now I bid you adieu. May our paths never cross again...|

3654|Follow me! And don't get scared, now.|
3655|Here we are, rook! The annual Huntathon! Don't get scared now.|
3656|Van Pelt and the others already have their hands full with a big lugabug in the back.|
3657|Now's your chance to see real hunters in action. Try not to get killed or anything!|
3658|All right, on the double! Let's do this!|
3659|Oh no!|
3660|Ah, lugnut! I think I set the timer too short... FIRE IN THE HOLE!|
3661|What the-?! What are YOU doing here?|
3662|Move your buns unless you want 'em blasted off! Yeeeeeeehaaaaaww!|
3663|Don't you walk away from me!  |
3664|I apologize. I thought by refusing to fight, I'd quell your rage. It seems I was mistaken!|
3665|Take that!|
3666|Phew!|
3667|A pity, but I'm afraid this conversation is over.|
3668|You'll have to forgive me for taking my leave. We shall see each other again soon.|
3669|She got away...|
3670|This is your last chance... you hear me?! Get the HELL out of here...|
3671|Or the next thing out of your mouth... will be your tongue... after my axe goes through your head!|
3672|I'll deal with this charlatan. You finish off the rest.|
3673|You and what army?|
3674|W-wait a sec! Something's... something's wrong!|
3675|Wh-what the-?!|
3676|KILL him! Kill him, NOW!|
3677|Your illustrious leader has been captured!|
3678|Surrender now or you'll have a vacant position to fill!|
3679|You really think... that will work?|
3680|We'll die before we surrender!|
3681|Hah!|
3682|Yeek!|
3683|Dear me. I guess I don't know my own strength sometimes...|
3684|You have a death wish?!|
3685|You realize you just made a... declaration of war, right? Or did that slip your mind, too?|
3686|You'll have plenty of time to repent... IN HELL!|
3687|If I were you, I'd turn on those pretty little heels of yours...|
3688|and GET OUT of here.|
3689|Yeesh, these guys are insane!|
3690|You're back!|
3691|Omi, Omi! Here're the crab legs you wanted.|
3692|Perfecto-mundo! Time to get cookin'! Check this out!|
3693|First... you dunk the crab legs in... WHOLE!|
3694|Then, a dash of my secret seasonings!|
3695|O-Omi... the food looks... kinda weird, doesn't it?|
3696|Voilà! It is finished! My most glooorious creation!|
3697|Are we... REALLY supposed to eat this?|
3698|Of course! Dig in! Dig in! Don't want it to get cold!|
3699|I'm beGINNING to lose my PATIENCE!|
3700|Where are you going?!|
3701|I'll take it from here!|
3702|Ahhh!|
3703|What's wrong with you?  Can't you do ANYthing?!|
3704|B-but...|
3705|Behave yourself!|
3706|Oh, come! It's only a baby otter...|
3707|Mess with me and you'll live to regret it!|
3708|We haven't got all DAY, Omi!|
3709|One second! I just need ooooone second!|
3710|Are you ready for this?!|
3711|The true meaning of cooking all comes down to this!|
3712|Bon appetit!|
3713|Louis, is it... SAFE to, uh... eat this?|
3714|Oh, yes! Omi's cooking is the best!|
3715|Portal repair! Portal repair! Gimme just ONE moment!|
3716|Portal's in ship-shape and as shape as a ship! Feel free to head up to the next stage!|
3717|Help! D-Dragomon! They were waiting for us!|
3718|At last! The Abyssal Crab is down for the count.|
3719|Better nab its shell before it's too late!|
3720|Wh-wh-what's that noise?|
3721|A teeming herd of Wingruses?!?|
3722|Could it be... because the Abyssal Crab ate all their brothers and sisters?|
3723|Things are about to get sticky! Better hop on top!|
3724|Defeat strong Dragomon for a chance at obtaining powerful combat mounts.|
3725|Each of these ferocious mounts comes with its own unique skills.|
3726|Capture them all to become a true Dragomon Master!|
3727|IT'S A STAMPEDE!!|
3728|Listen up! You have a very important mission.|
3729|I'll fill you in on our current plan of action.|
3730|Though, first of all, I just have to say...|
3731|That I really can't STAND those two.|
3732|But let me continue...|
3733|We've just entered Dragomon migration season.|
3734|You can imagine that thousands of Dragomon all jumping ship at once could cause a few mishaps.|
3735|That's why it's our job to guide all migrating Dragomon towards the right routes.|
3736|Keep 'em away from the towns and all that, you know?|
3737|Bain and Agatha are already at the front of the pack.|
3738|There's bound to be a few stragglers, though, which is why we're gonna use sweet-smelling bonfires to lure them back on-track.|
3739|Of course, there's also the chance that some of the bigger brutes could destroy the bonfires, which is why we've got point guards on surveillance.|
3740|YOUR job, however...|
3741|...is to act as our last line of defense to keep those flames flaming!|
3742|Supplies and such will all be delivered directly to the points of contact, so there's no need to worry.|
3743|Any questions? If not, then let's get to our posts!|
3744|Keep it up! You've got the makings of greatness in ya!|
3745|How could you forget about me?!|
3746|Time to put all those new skills to work!|
3747|Ah? Oh, Lenora! You're here, too!|
3748|Ahaha, I was only joking!|
3749|Yeeouch!!|
3750|No Dragomon will be getting through on MY watch!|
3751|Oh!|
3752|Nash, it's you!|
3753|What kind of balderdash are you going to try this time?|
3754|I swear, that guy NEVER changes!|
3755|Th-they didn't MEAN to! So... so please don't hurt them!|
3756|How those two put up with each other is beyond me.|
3757|Those bonfires are custom creations by yours truly! Don't let 'em go out!|
3758|Thanks so much for your help.|
3759|V-... visions of gnashing teeth were flashing through my head!|
3760|W-... wait! This... this vision! I have seen the light and been born anew in its splendor!|
3761|A recipe of legendary proportions! Suddenly it's all so clear! I-... I must write it down immediately!|
3762|Thanks much! Tootle-oo and smell ya later!|
3763|After much huffing and puffing, the chest is finally dragged ashore.|
3764|Hah? What's that weird noise? Hey, get away from my treasure!|
3765|Wh-what the-?! A Spyrosaur!!|
3766|Get your eyes off my treasure, dagnabbit! Stay back! Just stay back, you hear?! Come any closer and I'll pop you one right between the eyes!|
3767|It would seem everyone is present and accounted for, yes?|
3768|Then let us begin.|
3769|Princess Oriel, if you would be so kind.|
3770|Greetings, fellow dignitaries and counsellors.|
3771|I am Oriel, sister to the Fire Dragon Queen.|
3772|It is with great honor and humility that I stand here before you today.|
3773|I come to you with a request. A request to save my people.|
3774|There is a group called the Shadow Cabal that is loyal to Shadow Dragon Queen Zilthai|
3775|She and her army slaughtered my kind mercilessly and laid waste to our cities.|
3776|Only by offering the ultimate sacrifice was the Holy Dragon Queen able to seal her away...|
3777|But now, her followers have returned and are attempting to break the seal.|
3778|I am here under the guidance of my lady, the Holy Dragon Queen...|
3779|Should the Shadow Dragon Queen be released, her rage could swallow all of Wyveria, including the land you call home.|
3780|But there's more...|
3781|It would appear the only ones capable of protecting the seal are... you humans.|
3782|I have no doubt you are puzzled by this as greatly as I.|
3783|However, I trust the words of my lady. She helped create the seal all those years ago.|
3784|If there is anyone in this world who understands that seal, it is her.|
3785|That is why I have come to you today. I beseech you... please help our kingdom!|
3786|Order, now! Oooorder!|
3787|In light of this situation, we, the council, have reached a decision.|
3788|We'd like to send a task force of Copperheads and Falcons to assist with the situation in Drachmar.|
3789|I trust there are no objections?|
3790|With all due respect, your honor...|
3791|We Falcons are already knee-deep in problems of our own. We can't just send out our best guys and leave the nest empty.|
3792|We'd have appreciated some prior consultation...|
3793|Master Pelt, the council expresses deep condolences for your order and its... situation.|
3794|Perhaps we could offer you this...|
3795|You agree to ready a task force, and we'll reduce your order's load for the month, yes?|
3796|Hmm...|
3797|Fine. We'll do it. I'll make sure my best men are on the force.|
3798|Marvelous! I'm glad we can see eye to eye on matters such as this, hm?|
3799|And perhaps you'll be able to arrange transportation to Drachmar, as well?|
3800|After all, you DID save the princess's life. She would feel SO much better under YOUR protection...|
3801|...I suppose that could be arranged.|
3802|Splendid. I'd like to announce this meeting adjourned, then!|
3803|Thus establishes the pact between Drachmar and the Central Continent. I'd like everyone to begin preparations at once!|
3804|...there's something I'd like to discuss with you, sir...|
3805|Wh-what's going on?|
3806|The Stygian Leopards! What happened to them?!|
3807|Blast!|
3808|I... I actually...|
3809|Whoaaah!|
3810|Watch out! They're no longer being controlled!|
3811|Ahh-!!|
3812|Th-... the queen is... still inside... You must... help her...|
3813|Explosions... EXPLOSIONS!!|
3814|Just leave this big hunk of rock to us!|
3815|More! I need more dynamite! Hehe... HEHEHE!!|
3816|That... that's too much! You're gonna blow us to smithereens!|
3817|RUUUUUUN!!|
3818|Rocks go boom! Rocks go BOOM!!|
3819|Leave this giant eyesore to me!|
3820|Get a load of THIS!|
3821|KA-DUNK!|
3822|Does it tickle?|
3823|All clear, boss! Go find that queen, yeah?|
3824|Esh-Baal, open your eyes!|
3825|We promised each other!|
3826|We promised never to let ourselves be consumed by that madness!|
3827|The seal cannot be... broken...|
3828|Yes, that's right... I... I... I haven't killed you all yet!!|
3829|Wait a minute. The seal? ...I know what to do!|
3830|Continue weakening Esh-Baal. I've thought of a way to bring her back to herself!|
3831|No! Esh-Baal has entered the very core of the Sealed Sanctuary! If THAT appears, we may already be too late!|
3832|Do you see those energy stones? Destroy them—quickly! It will allow me to suppress the seal long enough for you to enter the main sanctuary!|
3833|I'll use my power to keep the portal open as long as possible. Esh-Baal... it's all up to you now!|
3834|I'm your enemy here! Or have you forgotten already?|
3835|Y-you...|
3836|Ha! Is that really all you've got? I expected so much more from you.|
3837|Eat my pyres, Shadow Dragon trash!|
3838|These soldiers... has the entire army been wiped out?|
3839|I have a bad feeling about this. Move it, gents! We may already be too late! |
3840|The time approaches. I've no time to play with you anymore.|
3841|Where the hell do you think you're going?! |
3842|Move it, gents! We need to be inside that sanctuary NOW!|
3843|What's this? Adorable little hornless here to visit ME?|
3844|How about a WELCOME GIFT!!|
3845|Zilthai, stop! Has your mind truly been twisted this tight?|
3846|If it isn't my sweet, sweet sister! How THOUGHTFUL of you to drop by!|
3847|Do you even realize what you're doing?! This world... this world will...|
3848|As if I want to hear ANYthing YOU have to say, Ashar! I've lost my faith in you. I've lost my faith in all of you! You betrayed us, Ashar!|
3849|You must fight it, Zilthai! Fight the madness! Don't let it control you!|
3850|SHUT UP! Still as hypocritical as ever, I see. I suppose some things never change, DO they?|
3851|Nnngh...!  |
3852|Soon... SOON...!!|
3853|Soon I shall rise again, Ashar. Soon I'll be back to do what I should have done so long ago! I'll find you, Ashar... I'LL FIND YOU!|
3854|The situation is more dire than I could have imagined. If the Shadow Cabal succeed in their aims, it would spell disaster.|
3855|I need to recover my strength, but I will follow momentarily. I beg of you to make haste!|
3856|I'll protect you!|
3857|...thank the maker.|
3858|My, my! Who's this I spy?|
3859|Tsk, tsk. So careless.|
3860|Humans? How interesting. I DO enjoy having an audience!|
3861|Stay out of this, hornless!|
3862|You okay?|
3863|Tsk, tsk, such low-level magic. ...dispel!|
3864|...thanks.|
3865|Where's the queen?|
3866|The Shadow Cabal has successfully entered the Sealed Sanctuary. They were accompanied by their leader, Queen Zilthai.|
3867|This ain't over yet. C'mon, there still might be something we can do!|
3868|What?!|
3869|Rare fruits! Get your rare fruits here! All the way from across the sea—you've never tasted anything like this before!|
3870|Hey, what gives? I swear I've seen that growing on those trees in the Broilt Charlands...|
3871|...!!|
3872|What's THAT thing over there? Look at its ears!|
3873|I've heard about those things before.|
3874|Apparently, they're called  Hoppalongs or something like that.|
3875|Do, uh... do ALL these Hoppalongs just stand around pulling out their own hair? Pretty weird if you ask me...|
3876|Listen up, boys! We drakelings have to learn to focus our power into even everyday tasks!|
3877|Yes, sir!|
3878|Everyday tasks like wood-chopping!|
3879|I want all these logs chopped before suppertime!|
3880|What another beautiful day in the Volcazar...|
3881|And yet, I can't help but feel as though these days of ours are numbered. Morbid, I know.|
3882|Don't worry your pretty little head! Whatever happens, Lady Esh-Baal'll be here to protect us!|
3883|Man, oh, man, am I POOPED! C'mon, the boss isn't looking—we can take a quick break!|
3884|Hey! Get back to work! We get caught and we'll be out on our bums again with no jobs and no beds!|
3885|You're suuuuuch a fraidy-cat! Just one minute—c'mooooon!|
3886|All right, all right... I suppose it couldn't hurt...|
3887|Whaddaya two think yer doin', huh?!|
3888|Y-Y-YIKES!!|
3889|Who are all those new people, huh?|
3890|They look so scary! They don't even have any horns! What if... what if they wanna hurt us?|
3891|Don't be afraid! Chin up!|
3892|I'll protect you!|
3893|Can-... can anyone help me move my stuff back to my house?|
3894| |
3895|I'm afraid I can't promise much beyond my eternal gratitude and appreciation...|
3896|But, uh... hey! How about an autographed headshot? These things'll be worth a fortune one day!|
3897|Any takers?|
3898|I've looked everywhere, I swear! You don't... think he would have gone in THERE, do you?|
3899|No way! Even HE'S not that stupid!|
3900|Yeah. The last kid who ran in there almost got a wooden spoon to his bum! Lucky for him, Sir Eller'd been drinking from that bottle of his again...|
3901|I guess you're right. He's gotta be somewhere else! But... where?!|
3902|You say you saw some kind of "suspicious shadow?"|
3903|Understood. I'll relay this to the rest of the guard. We'll have someone look into this straightaway.|
3904|To think! Outsiders... at the sacred altar! What have things come to these days?|
3905|Let's just pray this doesn't offend the ancient dragon gods!|
3906|I really don't know what Princess Oriel is thinking...|
3907|#&7$Chester##br#
"Life's an adventure, my friend! Don't you go forgettin' that!#br#
 Sure, there might be man-eating critters li-ble ta crunch your face off, but that's#br#
 where you've gotta stand yer ground!" Chester pounds his chest with his fist,#br#
 jaw clenched in resolute determination. #M325020$Chester$4$$1$0#|
3908|Ah, Nilly! There you are! How'd you end up here?|
3909|So, shall we try to persuade my dad again? There must be another way...|
3910|Running to and fro at my father's whim? So ridiculous... What if you'd had an accident?|
3911|Is earning his approval more important than your life?|
3912|I want to make you happy... Am I worth falling out with your family?|
3913|I know your father is trying to make things tough for me. But I won't be discouraged.|
3914|I know what I must do: bring back the Heartstone! Then you and I...|
3915|I knew there was no persuading you! But how are you going to fight those beasts with just your bare hands?|
3916|This is an axe I stole from my father's toolshed. Take it with you! You'd better get going. After dark it gets even more dangerous...|
3917|I'll wait here for you. Once you've brought back the stone, we can finally begin our happily-ever-after...|
3918|Let me deal with that leopard on the far right. I'll leave the rest to you two.|
3919|I just took a good look. The leopards are gathering on the riverbank.|
3920|What shall we do...? If there's no way to pass through here, the harvest in the orchard and vegetable patch will go to waste. |
3921|Most of the plants are already dead anyway! I haven't had the chance to water them in ages.|

4042|Must not... go into the light...|
4043|That last chord was a... real doozy...|
4044|I believe a... retreat is in order...|
4045|My training... wasn't enough!!|
4046|What a world... what a world...|
4047|That was... unexpected...|
4048|So close, and yet... so far...|
4049|Think of me... think of me proudly...|

4075|Lend me your strength, Lord!|
4076|On the third day, I will... rise again...|
4077|Is it just my imagination or are you trying to tick me off?|
4078|Look what you did, you oaf! That was my favorite outfit!|
4079|Argh! I don't think the economy-size box of aspirin is going to cut it this time.|
4080|The flames are mesmerizing, aren't they?|
4081|Bet you're really starting to feel the heat now! These flames will lick that smile right off your face!|
4082|Don't tell me the fire's out already! Our little weenie roast was just getting started!|
4083|The impudence! The audacity of it all!|
4084|You'll find that the gods don't forgive and forget so easily.|
4085|Whew! I'm beat... I could really use a nap right about now...|
4086|First things first. Do. Not. Mess. With. The. 'Do... PERIOD.|
4087|Have you been living under a rock all this time? Everyone knows a woman's hair is her crowning glory!|
4088|My hair could really use an intensive moisturizing treatment right about now...|
4089|That's not my name! Or can't you read?!|
4090|I'm a girl! Are you blind, too?!|
4091|Now I'm REALLY offended! I'm a girl, I tell you!|
4092|Even the most devoted fans must learn to control themselves!|
4093|The idol doesn't take too kindly to rudeness!|
4094|Boohoo! Woe is me! Don't tell me I've already worn out my welcome!|
4095|But I just got here! You lookin' for a fight?|
4096|You wanna hunt? Humph! Sounds like a lot of trouble, if you ask me...|
4097|Urrrrrgh... Just lemme rest!|
4098|You canNOT be serious! YOU'RE my opponent?!|
4099|So, it all boils down to this, eh? Can't we just get along?|
4100|Ow! That really smarts! Guess I'm more out of shape than I thought.|

"Participating in the Hoppadrome requires #&46$tickets#.#br#
 There are #&46$two types# of #&46$tickets# available." #M816010s100+30$Manuel$$$1$0#

#&7$Manuel##br#
"El primero is the ticket that Simón so graciously imparted on you earlier—the #&46$silver ticket#.#br# This ticket can only be used by individuals, yes? They should be easy to obtain, as well.#br#
 So long as you regularly take assignments from the Hunters' League, you should have no problem." #M816010s100+30$Manuel$$$1$0#

#&7$Manuel##br#
"El segundo is a much rarer, more valuable ticket—the #&46$golden ticket#. To participate#br# in the tournament with your companions, you will need to obtain one of these shiny stubs.#br#
 In order to get your hands on one, however, you will need to accept rare Dragomon#br# assignments. Besting these powerful beasts will take considerable guáramo, I would imagine."

#&7$Farina##br#
"Easy there, my long-eared friend! You'll first need to prepare #&46$invitation cards# specific#br#
 to the sort of dinner you'd like to host! Gotta let the guests know what they're in for, yeah?"

"Well, it's a pleasure to meet you, %n%.#br#
 I suspect we'll be seeing a lot of each other in the coming weeks!#br#
 I'm the go-to shop for #&46$potions# around here, and don't let anyone else tell you otherwise!" #M307010$Primrose$822$51$1$0#|
10216|#&7$Norman##br#
"Whazzat? My invoice? Bleh. Just toss it somewhere. I don't care."#br#
 Norman barely even glances at you—too busy with his work?—so you carefully#br#place his invoice on the nearby counter. #M308010$Norman$1$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Not wanting to come off as rude, you introduce yourself with a little bow.#br#
 Norman, however, simply snorts dust out his nose before yawning in apathy.#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Norman##br#
"A fresh-faced hunter? Bah monbug! All you hunters are the same.#br#
 They come to me as rookies just BEGGING me to forge 'em some sleek, new #&46$weapons#,#br#
 but as soon as they 'learn' how to 'craft their own,' they couldn't care less about dear, old Norman!#br#
 The icing on the cake? They come to ME with their shoddy, homemade gear asking for repairs!" #M308010$Norman$4$$1$0#

#&7$Norman##br#
"Some of these overweening gadabouts have even started to sell those hunks of metal they#br#
 call 'weapons!' Can you imagine? The nerve of these windbags! Whatever happened to#br#
 'respect your weapon-selling elders?' If I'da known things would get this bad, I'd have gone#br#into a different line of work! Like plumbing. Yeah, plumbing..."#M308010$Norman$826$56$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Norman seems ready to settle in for a long rant.#br#
 You'd best skedaddle if you don't want your ear talked off.#char$$2$$0$0#|
10217|#&7$Lon Baney##br#
"Ah, greetings, child! I've not seen your face around here before.#br#
 I am Lon Baney, the president of the bank here in Elysium. Might I help you with something?" #M703030$Lon Baney$4$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You hand over the invoice from Omi and#br#
 introduce yourself to the friendly old codger.#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Lon Baney##br#
"Oh! Then you're that promising new Falcon recruit I'd heard tell of.#br#
 What was your name again? Ah, yes... '%n%.' A fine name, yes. A fine name.#br#
 Well, you're now officially in my books!#br#
 You're free to use our #&46$bank# whenever you please." #M703030$Lon Baney$821$$1$0#

#&7$Lon Baney##br#
"#&46$Big or small, we take it all!##br#
 That's our motto here at the Bank of Elysium.#br#

"Howdy and welcome to Lawrence's #&46$armor emporium#!#br#
 What can I do ya for today, friend? Ohhhh, I know just the ticket!#br#
 YOU want this stylish new leopard robe I just got in the other day!#br#
 Take a gander—it couldn't be grander! One purchase you WON'T regret."   #M305030$Lawrence$4$51$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You wave your hands in polite refusal as the overly-friendly purplette tries to drape#br#
 a leopard robe over your shoulders. Quickly, you hand him the invoice that Omi#br#entrusted to you.#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Lawrence##br#
"Oh, dear me! I apologize for all that. Here you were just trying to carry out a favor, and all.#br#
 It is certainly a PLEASURE to meet you, though. May we have a long, prosperous relationship, hm?#br#
 ...though, uh, you're quite sure you won't be buying anything? Just a look? A tiny little look?#br#
 I do have the BEST armor here in Elysium..."#M305030$Lawrence$4$54$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 If he keeps this up, you're liable to start your first day in Elysium with a two million gold tab!#br#
 Better leave before you make some unwise purchases.#char$$2$$0$0#|
10220|You finally report to Delphia in the Falcon's Nest, where you run into the Falcon Leader himself—Van Pelt! He leaves a bit of a strange taste in your mouth, but you're not about to argue when he's showering you with praises.

Just as you're getting chummy, a purple-haired Falcon with a penchant for sass shows up. Just who is this smart-mouthed girl, and what's her problem?|
10221|#&7$%n%##br#
 Just as Delphia starts scanning the perimeter, you hear raucous laughter from behind you.#br#
 You turn around and spot a boisterous gentleman emerging from the nearby group of Falcons.#br#
 He saunters towards the two of you with the most bumptious grin you've ever seen plastered#br#across his face. #M330090$Van Pelt$351$54$1$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"Miiiiiighty fine weather we've got ourselves today, eh? Sun's shinin'. Birds#br#
 are singin'. Mons are brayin'. Why, it almost makes me wanna take a stroll by the water!#br#
 Whoa! Delphia! Fancy meeting you here. How's about you and me take that stroll together?"#br#
 The man changes instantly from amiable idealist to suave lady-killer. #M330090$Van Pelt$4$54$1$0#

#&7$Delphia##br#
"Funny. I seem to remember you using that exact line on me LAST WEEK."#br#
 Delphia's eyes grow murderous, but she instantly calms down, shyly brushing her hair aside.#br#
 "Oh, Van Pelt! You came at just the right time. This is our newest recruit, %n%.#br#
 It seems Bain is QUITE taken by them. Wrote a personal recommendation and everything!" #M327090$Delphia$821$$1$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"Did I? Of all the—I mean, uh... I have no idea what you're talking about! Ahaha!!#br#
 What's all this, though? A recruit that impressed the great Bain?#br#
 THIS I've gotta see. Getting that nutcracker to SMILE is nigh impossible." #M330090$Van Pelt$823$53$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You realize that the overweening libertine standing in front of you is, in fact, the leader of#br#
 the Falcons. THE Falcons. The Falcons you've practically devoted your life's worth to#br#
 be able to join. You quickly stop thinking about the matter. Instead, you offer him#br#
 an affable handshake coupled with your widest grin.#char$$821$$0$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"Heh. Well, looks like Bain chose well.#br#
 You seem to have a good head on you, kid—I've got a bit of an eye for these things myself!#br#
 Keep it up, and you'll make a real name for yourself around here.#br#
 I look forward to seeing what you're made of." #M330090$Van Pelt$821$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You respond with a furtive nod, happy to have the approval of the Falcon leader himself.#br#
 Just as you're giving yourself a mental pat on the back, your thoughts are cut short by a#br#sharp voice.#char$$822$$0$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"The day you take stock in anything this windbag says is the day you kiss your dignity goodbye.#br#
 He's given that same speech to everyone who's walked in the door. Even the janitor!" #M320090$Agatha$4$$1$0#|

"A-... Agatha! Ahaha, where'd, uh, where'd you come from?#br#
 Didn't see you... sliiiiither up! If you guys and gals don't need me#br#
 for anything, I'll just, you know... excuse myself..."#M330090$Van Pelt$821$54$1$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"What else would I be doing besides hanging around here? It's all I'm allowed to DO!#br#
 You haven't assigned me anything in weeks! I'm going crazy! Knick-knack, paddy whack!#br#
 The whole shebang! Give a girl a bone, here! Do you not trust me or something?" #M320090$Agatha$825$55$0$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"Me? Not TRUST you? P-... perish the thought! Ahaha... ha... I mean, clearly#br#
 you're just very overworked, yes. And we all just... thought you could use#br#
 a holiday... you know? Medicate—REJUVENATE yourself, yeah..."#M330090$Van Pelt$1$54$1$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"You're a load of bull!" #M320090$Agatha$4$$0$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"Ahaha, you're right! Very good! I'm strong like a bull, yes!#br#
 Erm... Delphiiiia? Is there anything—anything at all—that dear#br#Agatha could help with?" #M330090$Van Pelt$826$56$1$0#

#&7$Delphia##br#
"Hmm... you know! Actually, there IS a tiny little thing I'd been needing someone to take care#br#
 of for me. There's a load of compost that needs to be delivered to Cain's Woods."#M327090$Delphia$4$$0$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"HaHA! See? Perfect! I knew Delphia could—"Then..."#M330090$Van Pelt$1$51$1$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"You turn me into compost delivery boy, Pelt, and I swear to God,#br#
 I will deliver that compost into your open mouth!" #M320090$Agatha$821$$0$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"HA HA HA. Well, um, I'm sure we can, you know, find someone else to do it...#br#
 No bother, really... at all... ha..." All of a sudden, the city clock cheerfully chimes#br#
 the hour, breaking the awkward silence. #M330090$Van Pelt$827$56$1$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"Wouldja LOOK at the time! I really must be going. Have an important appointment#br#
 with my, erm, my gynecologist, YES! Don't wanna be late! Soooo... tootles!"#br#
 Van Pelt spins on his heels only to be abruptly jerked backwards by Agatha's grip on his collar. #M330090$Van Pelt$823$53$1$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"Funny, because you'll be NEEDing one after I introduce your extremities to my SWORD.#br#
 Get me a job, Pelt. A GOOD one. NOW!!"
   #M320090$Agatha$4$55$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Van Pelt looks about as emasculated as a man can get.#br#
 All of a sudden, his eyes snap into focus as though he's come up with an idea.#br#
 One hand covering his mouth, he covertly whispers something in Agatha's ear.#br#
 You watch as her eyes first widen in surprise, then narrow in burgeoning horror. #M330090$Van Pelt$821$$1$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"Well, that settles it! Bwahaha!#br#
 %n%, I officially knight thee Agatha's very own #&46$trainee#!#br#
 Do your best! Don't get killed! Yadda yadda yadda. Adios!"#br#
 Van Pelt quickly vamooses before Agatha can even think about arguing. #M330090$Van Pelt$824$51$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You, on the other hand, don't quite know what to make of what just happened.#br#
 Blinking in abrupt confusion, you stare after Van Pelt's retreating form.#char$$826$$0$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"I can't believe this! This is utter, complete, absolute-...!! UGH!#br#
 I don't get paid enough for this!" She marches up and yanks Bain's#br#
 recommendation letter from your hand. After a quick perusal, she#br#
 rolls her eyes and tosses it behind her. #M320090$Agatha$825$55$1$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"So I've gotta take care of this kid, now, is that how this works?#br#
 I'm some kind of glorified babysitter? Whatever! What's your name, rook?" #M320090$Agatha$821$$1$0#

#&7$Delphia##br#
"%n%. Their name is %n%. This is their very first day!#br#
 And they've already attracted quite the attention, too.#br#
 Now, then, %n%? She may seem a bit scary, but Agatha is one of our #&46$best hunters#.#br#
 I'll sure you'll be able to learn ever so much from her! Between tongue-lashings, that is..." #M327090$Delphia$821$$0$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"Don't get on my bad side, %n%. And don't be an idiot.#br#
 There's nothing that grinds my gears like a countrified ignoramus.#br#
 So, step up to the plate or leave the ballgame." #M320090$Agatha$4$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 She reaches a hand out towards you, and you instinctively cower;#br#
 however, you're simply rewarded with a rather jilted pat to the shoulder.#br#
 It'll probably leave a bruise.#char$1$$0$0#|
10230|You might have bitten off more than you can chew this time! A trainee? Under firecracker Agatha?! You'll be lucky to make it out of this one alive...

At any rate, you've been given your first task—collect tusks from Wingruses in Crescent Bay. Sounds easy enough... right?|
10231|#&7$Agatha##br#
"Well, what're we waiting for?#br#
 I've had enough of slumming around HQ.#br#
 Let's see what you're made of, rook." #M320090$Agatha$4$$1$0#

#&7$Delphia##br#
"Don't you think %n%'s already had enough for one day?#br#
 No doubt, their head is spinning like a dolly in a sandstorm!#br#
 Why don't you give them the rest of the day off?" #M327090$Delphia$4$$1$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"Day off? Day OFF?! There's nothing I hate WORSE than 'days off!'#br#
 And as my new trainee, %n% should hate them, too!#br#
 Isn't that right, %n%?" #M320090$Agatha$821$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Agatha's eyes widen with a voracious glint that freezes every capillary in your body.#br#
 You quickly nod in affirmation.#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"WONderful! See? Now then, let's me think...#br#
 Aha! You shall go to Crescent Bay and bring back some #&46$Wingrus tusks#!#br#
 This will prove to me your hunting and navigational prowess.#br#
 I'll remain here to clock your time. We have to set the bar SOMEwhere, you know." #M320090$Agatha$4$51$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You quickly scurry off before Agatha can shoot you another one of her cadaverous glares.#br#
 As you're running, you hear Delphia call out from behind you.#char$$301$$0$0#

#&7$Delphia##br#
"%n%, deeeear! Simply find one of our gearcoptor pilots!#br#
 Let them know where you need to go, and they'll have you#br#
 there straightaway!" #M327090$Delphia$4$$1$0#|
10232|#&7$Agatha##br#
"What're you doing lollygagging around here, for? Get going!#br#
 Those Wingruses aren't going to amputate their own tusks#br# and hand them to you on a silver platter!" #M320090$Agatha$4$$1$0#|
10233|#&7$%n%##br#
 Out of breath, you hand Agatha the pile of Wingrus tusks you collected.#br#
 She seems unfazed—coolly counting them before giving you a thorough once-over.#br#
 You feel a bit like you've been put on display.#char$$2$$0$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"Well... you've passed, I suppose. You DID bring me the tusks.#br#
 Don't be expecting any glooorious praises, though. I don't do lip service.#br#
 You'll need to demonstrate a lot more than the ability to harvest a few tusks." #M320090$Agatha$4$$1$0#

#&7$Delphia##br#
"Come now, Agatha. Don't you think you're being a little harsh?#br#
 I think %n% is performing absolutely splendidly! Quite better than I did, at their age.#br#
 If only I could have such a dedicated young apprentice." #M327090$Delphia$2$$0$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"I could lay off them... if I wanted them to improve at the speed of a SNAIL!#br#
 How am I supposed to rely on them to do ANYthing of importance if I can't even be#br#
 sure they can successfully gather tusks?" #M320090$Agatha$4$$1$0#

#&7$Delphia##br#
"Oh, Agatha. You really never change, do you?#br#
 I can imagine you have some tough days ahead of you, %n%,#br#
 but you'll undoubtedly learn a great deal. Just... try not to strain yourself." #M327090$Delphia$821$$0$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"%n%? I'M the one who just got a bagful of 'DO NOT WANT' unloaded#br#
 on my lap. Next time I see Pelt, I'll have to RE-strain myself#br#
 to keep from clocking him upside the jaw!" #M320090$Agatha$826$56$1$0#|
10240|The Huntathon over and your breath having finally returned, you've just reunited with Agatha when Qyubey, the Hoppalong Emissary, decides to pay a visit to the Falcon's Nest. She hasn't come alone, either. With a band of young Hoppalongs in tow, she explains that it's high-time the lot of them found themselves a hunter companion.

Agatha seems veeeery interested in this turn of events...|
10241|#&7$Agatha##br#
"All right, then... what next? What next?"#br#
 Agatha's eyes begin roaming the environs.#M320090$Agatha$4$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 All of a sudden, her gaze comes to a stop. You turn around to see what's#br#
 caught her attention, and are met with a most peculiar sight. A company#br#
 of Hoppalongs is making its way up the steps to the Falcon's Nest. At the head#br#
 of the force is a Hoppalong adorned in somewhat garish attire, her ears straight and tall. #M802010s100+30$Qyubey$301$$1$0#

#&7$Delphia##br#
"Oh, Emissary Qyubey! What a pleasure.#br#
 We've not seen you around these parts for quite some time.#br#
 I do hope things have been treating you well." #M327090$Delphia$4$51$0$0#

#&7$Qyubey##br#
"Greetings, my fair Delphia. The pleasure is all mine.#br#
 And quite! As always, you Falcons have been taking good care of us.#br#
 The Hoppalong–Falcon alliance remains as strong a backbone as ever." #M802010s100+30$Qyubey$821$$1$0#

#&7$Delphia##br#
"The appreciation is mutual, my dear friend.#br#
 What brings you here to the Falcon's Nest today?#br#
 I'm afraid Van Pelt has stepped out for a moment,#br# but I'd be glad to help you with anything you need." #M327090$Delphia$822$$0$0#

#&7$Qyubey##br#
"Ohoho, all the better, really! As it would happen, some of my cadets#br#
 have reached the ripe age where training amongst other Hoppalongs can only#br#
 do so much. It's time for them to spread their ears and find a #&46$hunter companion#! #M802010s100+30$Qyubey$822$$1$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"Hmm... Hoppalongs looking for new hunters, you say?#br# Agatha takes a step forward, slyly shoehorning her way into#br#
 the conversation. #M320090$Agatha$4$51$0$0#|
10242|...|
10243|#&7$Agatha##br#
"Come along, Louis. Aren't you going to say hello to Qyubey?"#br#
 Surprised, you glance down to see the little brown Hoppalong you hadn't#br#
 even noticed was there. He shyly pokes his head out before meandering#br#towards the group. #M320090$Agatha$4$$1$0#

#&7$Louis##br#
"H-... hello, Miss Qyubey. It's b-b-been so long!#br#
 I... miss everyone so, so much..." Big, salty tears#br#
 glisten in the corners of Louis's eyes as his bottom lip quivers. #M804010s100+30$Louis$827$$1$0#

#&7$Qyubey##br#
"Don't cry, my boy! You'll scare my charges.#br#
 Try and—... w-wait a minute! Agatha?! I-I mean... ohoho, when did YOU get here?"#br#
 Qyubey's demeanor changes almost instantly, and she takes a step backwards.#br#
 It seems Agatha has that effect on a lot of people. #M802010s100+30$Qyubey$4$$0$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"Hello to you, too."#br#
 Agatha rests her hands on her hips. #M320090$Agatha$4$51$1$0#

#&7$Qyubey##br#
"R-RIGHT! Hello! Hello, hello, yes, it's wonderful to see you today, Miss Spectrall.#br#
 That was quite impolite of me, yes. You have my utmost apologies.#br#
 I was simply caught off-guard for a moment there.#br#   #M802010s100+30$Qyubey$822$$0$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"Whatever. If you're really feeling SO debased, go ahead and introduce#br#
 those sacks of fluff behind you. I need to see who's up to snuff." #M320090$Agatha$821$$1$0#

#&7$Qyubey##br#
"S-... surely, you're not interested in an additional companion, Miss Spectrall!#br#
 The Hoppalong-Hunter relationship is traditionally a monogamous affair, after all..."#M802010s100+30$Qyubey$1$$0$0#

#&7$Delphia##br#
"Indeed, Agatha. There are still many hunters here who've not yet#br#
 taken a companion. Mightn't we let them be the first to meet with this#br#
 new group of Hoppalongs?" #M327090$Delphia$4$$1$0#

#&7$Louis##br#
"Are you... are you... not happy with me, Miss Agatha?#br#
 D-d-did I do something to disappoint you?"#br#
 Louis's voice cracks. #M804010s100+30$Louis$827$$0$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"What are you blubbering about? I'm not looking for myself!#br#
 My new trainee needs a companion." #M320090$Agatha$4$$1$0#

#&7$Louis##br#
Louis seems, at first, relieved, but the overwhelming onslaught of emotions#br#
 must have been too much for him, because he abruptly faints with a desolate moan. #M804010s100+30$Louis$1$$0$0#

#&7$Qyubey##br#
"Well, I, erm... TYPICALLY, we only invite hunters with some degree of#br#
 experience to make pacts with Hoppalongs..."#M802010s100+30$Qyubey$822$$0$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"Funny. Because I TYPICALLY feel the sudden, unquenchable urge to dismember#br# things when I'm angry!" You can practically see the flames dancing in Agatha's eyes. 
  
   #M320090$Agatha$4$51$1$0#

#&7$Qyubey##br#
"D-d-d-d I say experienced hunters? I surely meant any hunter Miss Spectrall thinks has promise!#br#
 I'll... I'll introduce them right away! Right away, ma'am."#br#
 Qyubey turns around so fast, she practically rams into her entourage. #M802010s100+30$Qyubey$825$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Oof!"#br#
 One of the Hoppalongs is pulled out of line, and they abruptly fall to the ground.#br#
 With a little shake of their ears, they push themselves to their feet.#pets100+30$$3$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You glance down at the little runt just as they turn their big, brown eyes towards you.#br#
 A chill runs up your spine, gathering in the base of your skull.#br#
 There's something familiar about this Hoppalong, almost as if you've known them your whole life.#char$$806$$0$0#

#&7$Delphia##br#
"Oh, how sweet! Look at them! It's almost as if they were made for each other."#br#
 Delphia smiles warmly as the small Hoppalong shyly lowers their head.  #M327090$Delphia$2$51$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Miss... Miss Qyubey? I-... this hunter, I-...#br#
 I'd really like to go with them."#br#
 The Hoppalong glances up at you bashfully.#pets100+30$$2$$1$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"Hmm... what do you think, %n%?#br#
 Seems kinda like a runt, if you ask me.#br#
 Might not pull through when push comes to shove."#br#
 Agatha lackadaisically waves her hand. #M320090$Agatha$2$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You're not sure what kind of situation Agatha's referring to, but you ARE sure that there's#br#
 something about this Hoppalong that's meant to be. You respond that you'd be glad to have#br#them as a companion.#char$$821$$0$0#

#&7$Delphia##br#
"How perfect! It's decided, then.#br# Congratulations to the both of you, and may you stand by each other's#br#
 side through thick and thin for years to come."#br#
 Delphia clasps her hands together with a delighted smile.
   #M327090$Delphia$821$51$0$0#

#&7$Qyubey##br#
"Yeah, uh... congratulations! Heh heh... that was easier than I thought it would be."#br#

10250|Armed with your very own companion, you're informed by Agatha that the next step is teaching the two of you to work together.

 Qyubey wanders off in the direction of her charges, somewhat distracted. #M802010s100+30$Qyubey$822$$0$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"Certainly, my lady! taking on#br#
 hunting jobs, right? Or is that still asking too much of you? Bah. I should probably#br#
 send you out on at least one training mission, I suppose." #M320090$Agatha$4$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You glance down at %p%, and the two of you turn towards Agatha#br#
 with simultaneous nods. Training sounds like an awfully smart idea.#char$$806$$0$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"I've got just the idea. We'll head over to Crescent Beach and collect #&46$Harmony Shells#.#br#
 Yeah, yeah, I know—shell collecting, right? Sounds like a drag. But these puppies are#br#
 hard to find without help from a companion, so it'll teach the two of you to work#br#
 together without any of the rampant danger associated with hunting actual mons."   #M320090$Agatha$821$$1$0#|
10252|#&7$Angel##br#
"Hm? You one of the new Falcon recruits, kiddo?#br#
 What can I do you for?" Angel glances up from what#br#
 appears to be a mountain of paperwork. #M308060$Angel$822$$1$0#|
10253|#&7$Angel##br#
"Well, if it isn't the famous %n%!#br#
 Ahaha, don't be so modest. Agatha's already told me ALL about you.#br#
 How goes newbie life? Not overworked, are ya? Falcons treatin' you right?" #M308060$Angel$821$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You remember what Agatha told you and offer the man a polite bow#br#
 before introducing yourself. Rising back up, you procure the Harmony Shells#br#
 from your pack and hold them out for inspection.#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Angel##br#
"Ohoho! Harmony Shells, eh? Excellent.#br#
 You've got my thanks, kid. You and Agatha both.#br#
 See, one of our receptionists just goes bonkers over these#br#
 colorful clams. They keep her happy, you know?" #M308060$Angel$822$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 The man seems amiable enough—quite different from what you'd expected after#br#
 Agatha's warning. When it seems like you've nothing more to talk about, you#br#
 prepare to bid him farewell, when all of a sudden, a carrier pigeon flutters down#br#
 with a message from the Falcon's Nest. Angel rubs his chin as he slowly peruses it.#char$$821$$0$0#

#&7$Angel##br#
"Speak of the devil! It's from little Miss Agatha, herself. Seems something's come up, but#br#
 she wants you to keep training on your own... by #&46$taking on a few assignments##br#
 for the #&46$Hunters' League#! Heh, talk about perfect timing!#br#Wonder how she knew you were still here..."#M308060$Angel$4$$1$0#

#&7$Angel##br#
"Ah, well! Let's not twist the old noggins out of shape. Though, hm... actually,#br#
 I was wondering if you might do me a bit of a favor first..." Angel's voice lowers,#br#
 and he surreptitiously puts an arm around your shoulder, leading you towards#br#the shade. #M308060$Angel$826$$1$0#|
10255|#&7$Agatha##br#
"I heard the squawking, but figured I'd see if you could handle yourself.#br# Looks like I made the right choice. You all right, rook?" Agatha glances#br#
 down at the giant corpse sprawled across the dirt. #M320090$Agatha$4$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You reassure her of your lack of injury and present the three#br#
 Harmony Shells you succeeded in digging up.#char$$821$$0$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"Hmm... you've done well enough, I suppose, though it took you longer than expected.#br#
 Louis, here, can dig up a whole basketful of those in a matter of minutes!#br#
 You'd do well to train your own fuzzball so it doesn't keep slowing you down." #M320090$Agatha$4$$1$0#

#&7$Louis##br#
"Y-... y-you actually think I'm GOOD at something, Miss Agatha? M-my God!#br#
 It's like I'm staring into the face of the devil herself and having her bless me!" #M804010s100+30$Louis$4$$0$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"What did you say?! You worthless, self-centered, attention-grubbing ingrate!#br#
 I ougggghhttaaa...!! That's it! No dinner for you tonight!"#br#
 The very air around Agatha seems to crackle and pop. #M320090$Agatha$825$55$1$0#

#&7$Louis##br#
"F-f-f-forgive me, Miss Agatha! I didn't mean it! Honest!"#br#
 Louis curls up into a tiny, brown ball, quivering uncontrollably. #M804010s100+30$Louis$827$$0$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"Hmph. Well. We'll see. Maybe my mood will improve. Maybe it won't.#br#
 As for you, %n%, take those shells to #&46$Chairman Angel# back in Elysium.#br#
 Tell him they're in appreciation of his continued support of our order. DO try#br#
 to make a good impression. This man is in charge of the Hunters' League, after all." #M320090$Agatha$821$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You straighten your slouch and give a crisp salute, as though the man himself#br#
 were already monitoring your actions. Never hurts to be careful, right?#br#
 With one last nod, you set off for Elysium to find out more about this 'Hunters' League.'"#char$$806$$0$0#|
10256|Go to the valley|
10257|Take out the Macooky Pterosaur|
10260|You hand over the Harmony Shell to Angel and ask where Agatha is. Angel tells you she's been called to take care of some important Falcon business.

Since she's gone, you decide to take on a few assignments in your spare time. You have a few moves you've been meaning to practice, and you could always use a little cash in your pocket, right?|
10261|#&7$Angel##br#
"Ah, right. Of course! Should have figured you'd ask about that.#br#
 Let's just cut to the chase, then, shall we? The Hunters' League!#br#
 One of the biggest unions here in Elysium and highly respected to boot." #M308060$Angel$826$$1$0#

#&7$Angel##br#
"The way it works is simple enough—#&46$accept assignments, complete assignments,##br#
 #&46$and get paid!# Pretty nifty, eh? Some commissioners will put restrictions on which#br#
 hunters can accept their assignments, though. Mostly because they don't want some amateur#br#
 going out and getting themselves killed. So make sure you read the fine print!" #M308060$Angel$821$$1$0#

#&7$Angel##br#
"We get some pretty crazy assignments, sometimes. After all, there's all types.#br#
 Sometimes we even get new assignments for special occasions. You just never know!#br#
 That's why you should check with our receptionists regularly to keep#br#
 up-to-date on the newest, shiniest assignments." #M308060$Angel$4$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Sounds like these assignments could be a pretty fun way to test your mettle.#br#
 And they pay well too? 
 You're excited to give it a try. #char$$806$$0$0#

#&7$Angel##br#
"Agatha wanted you to get familiar with working on assignments.#br#
 Why don't you try completing a few?#br#
 After all, nothing can compare with gaining hands-on experience in the field!" #M308060$Angel$821$$1$0#

#&7$Angel##br#
"The assignments you'll be working on for now are all located on the island next to the#br#
 Central Continent. Please go find #&46$Vivian#, she will help get you started. #br#
 You can then #&46$reach your destination through the Portal#." #M308060$Angel$1$$1$0#

#&7$Angel##br#
"Ah, almost forgot. Completing assignments can also increase your reputation within#br#
 the various unions of Elysium. Get enough of it, and you can purchase special goods#br#
 from one of the Union Merchants scattered throughout town. Go find Wendel for more#br#
 info on all that. 'Fraid I'm not the most knowledgeable one to ask about union goods." #M308060$Angel$4$$1$0#

#&7$Angel##br#
"If you do a really good job on these assignments, and raise that reputation #br#
 of yours, I'll give you a #&46$little something# to sweeten the deal, what do you say? #br#
 Think of it as a housewarming gift of sorts. Anyway, good luck out there!#br#Not that you'll need it, I'm sure." #M308060$Angel$822$$1$0#|
10262|#&7$Angel##br#
"Got any questions, just come see me.#br#
 There's nothing I don't know! Well... mostly.#br#
#br#
#&46$*Complete assignments for the Hunters' League to increase your reputation, then report back to Angel. ##M308060$Angel$822$$1$0#|
10263|#&7$Angel##br#
"Wowie! Back already? And you're supposed to be a rookie?! Heh.#br# You're really somethin' else. There aren't even any assignments left#br#
 on the board! Bain was definitely right to keep his eye on you."
   #M308060$Angel$821$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You feel the heat rise to your face as you're pummeled with more praise.#br#
 Grinning shyly, you reassure him that you'll keep on doing the best you can.#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Angel##br#
"That's the spirit! Don't be so humble, though, kid! You deserve it.#br#
 Heck, I haven't seen a rookie like you in... in... well, in a long time!#br#
 Anyway, here's that #&46$little something# I promised you earlier..."#br# Angel procures a small, copper badge from the inside pocket of his jacket.
    #M308060$Angel$826$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 The badge is elaborately engraved—even the smallest of details readily evident in its#br# design. You run your thumb over its rough surface. In the badge's center is a mighty hawk#br#
 with wings outstretched. It seems to be staring at you, fierce and infallible. Behind the#br# hawk lie two crossed swords, adding to the imbued ferocity of the copper crest.
  
 #char$$806$$0$0#

#&7$Angel##br#
"This here is an official Falcon membership badge! Betcha weren't expecting that,#br# were you? Agatha asked me to keep an eye on you and let you have it if I was satisfied#br#
 with your performance. And, well, what can I say? Consider me satisfied!#br#
 You're now an official member of the Order of the Falcons." #M308060$Angel$4$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You're so startled, you almost drop the badge.#br#
 Not wanting to sound rude, but curious enough to risk it,#br#you ask how it is that Angel can have the final say in Falcon business.#char$$823$$0$0#

#&7$Angel##br#
"Ahaha, I know it may not make a lot of sense to you,#br# but all the unions here in Elysium are so interconnected that#br#
 getting approved for one is like getting approved for all of them!#br#
 And I AM the Hunters' League chairman, after all..."#M308060$Angel$1$$1$0#

#&7$Angel##br#
"So long as you're an officially recognized member of the league, you can accept#br#
 any of the assignments we have to offer! Well, so long as you meet the#br#
 requirements, and all. And this badge is physical proof of that!" #M308060$Angel$4$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You find yourself entirely overwhelmed by this act of recognition, but finally—a bit#br#
 flustered—you offer him your utmost thanks, while making sure to emphasize that you'll do#br#everything in your power not to let him down.#char$$822$$0$0#

#&7$Angel##br#
"Ahaha, thattaway, squirt! But you've already sped right through all the#br#
 available assignments for today, so how about we take a different approach?#br#
 There's actually someone I was hoping to introduce you to..."|
10264|#&7$Wendel##br#
"Awww right! Excellent! You must be that new recruit everyone's been gabbin' about, yeah?#br#
 Most pleased to make your acquaintance, hunter dude.#br#
 Name's Wendel. Old man Angel send you up here?" #M820010s100+30$Wendel$822$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You nod, glad you don't need to introduce yourself.#br#
 You add that you'd hoped to learn a bit more about Union Merchants.#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Wendel##br#
"Not much to explain, my righteous Romeo. All those assignments you can#br# flash your peepers at up on the old Hunters' League boards have already been#br#
 endorsed by their coinciding unions. So all YOU have to do is complete 'em, and#br#
 then you'll receive influence points for the union you so awesomely serviced. Get my drift?"
   #M820010s100+30$Wendel$831$$1$0#

#&7$Wendel##br#
"Get enough of that coveted kudos for any certain union, and you can buy#br#
 goods from their corresponding vendor! Some of us have got some stone-cold #br#
 selections, too. You'll most def wanna check back from time to time.#br#
 Come see us again soon, hunter dude!" #M820010s100+30$Wendel$4$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 So, different types of assignments will reward you reputation for different unions, huh?#br#
 It does sound simple enough, but you take a glance at some of the goods in the nearby shops#br#
 and realize you're going to need a lot more reputation first!#br#
 Better complete some more assignments.#char$$806$$0$0#|
10270|After a long series of assignments and Hoppalong adventures, it seems it's finally time for you to get back to business... Falcon style!

Agatha's asked you to report to Crescent Beach and check up on a team of rookie Falcons who've yet to report in. You hope your fellow comrades are in no danger, but you can't help hoping for another chance to prove your worth...|
10271|#&7$Angel##br#
"Thanks again for suffering Doreen's ceaseless need for entertainment.#br#
 I'd get even LESS done if I had to keep indulging her every hare-brained#br#
 idea. At any rate... it's time for you to get down to REAL business."#br#
 Angel crosses his arms in front of his chest, and you notice a note sticking out from his hand. #M308060$Angel$826$56$1$0#

#&7$Angel##br#
"Seems another set of rookies got assigned a job over on Crescent Beach, but it's been#br#
 a good couple of hours, now, since they've left, and there's been no sign of them.#br#
 Agatha wants you to head over to the beach and make sure they haven't, you know,#br#
 gotten themselves killed or anything. Think you can handle it?" #M308060$Angel$4$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You give a zealous nod, glad to be back on official Falcon business.#br#
 Then, with a little wave, you bid Angel farewell and take off for the beach.#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Angel##br#
"Give 'em heck out there, %n%!"#br#
 You hear Angel's voice from behind you, which only strengthens your resolve.#br#
 A smile playing on your lips, you hold your head up just a little higher. #M308060$Angel$822$$1$0#|
10272|#&7$Agatha##br#
"..."#br#
 Agatha seems thoroughly engrossed in the documents in her hands. Best not bother her... #M320090$Agatha$1$$1$0#|
10273|#&7$%n%##br#
 Upon arrival back at the Falcon's Nest, Agatha seems to have cooled down somewhat.#br#
 You find her studying a tissue sample you can only assume came from the wyvern.#br#
 Not wanting to break her concentration, you simply stand quietly off to the side.#char$$1$$0$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"...there? It's possible. Best to cover all our tracks, I suppose..."#br#
 She glances up in the midst of her murmuring and finally notices your presence.#br#
 "Ah, %n%. Perfect timing. We need to start our investigation.#br#
 Get over here so I don't feel like I'm shouting across the river Styx." #M320090$Agatha$4$$1$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"I took a few samples from that wyvern earlier—teeth, claws, even tissue.#br#
 We should be able to use these to start tracking its origins.#br#
 As a hunter, tracking is one of the most important skills you'll develop,#br#
 so open your orifices and listen up. I'm not gonna repeat myself." #M320090$Agatha$821$$1$0#|
10275|#&7$Agatha##br#
"A bunch of crabs? THAT'S what was giving you trouble? You two obviously need#br#
 some serious training. It was a mistake to send you out on your own so soon."#br#
 Agatha waggles her sword as she talks, making her lecture not only punitive#br#but physically dangerous as well. #bS00306##M320091$Agatha$4$$1$0#

#&7$Juneau##br#
"It-... it wasn't like that! We were already on the run, yeah! From something much bigger!#br#
 And, and... otherwise we totally would have been able to handle them ourselves!"#bS00306##M303091$Juneau$1$56$0$0#

#&7$Vela##br#
"Oh, hush it, Juneau! You and I both know we weren't ready for this.#br# We should be thankful we're still alive at all! If Agatha hadn't come,#br# I don't know WHAT would have happened..."
   #bS00306##M307091$Vela$825$55$0$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"You need to be prepared for anything as a hunter—even mistakes.#br#
 And if that means hiding yourself, then that means hiding yourself.#br#
 There's no shame in living to fight another day. Certainly better than#br# not living at all, yes? Now, tell me what happened." #bS00306##M320091$Agatha$4$$1$0#|
10276|#&7$Juneau##br#
"We... we, uh... nngh..."#br#
 Juneau winces and grabs his side.#br#He's in no condition to be standing, let alone speaking! #bS00306##M303091$Juneau$827$56$1$0#

#&7$Vela##br#
"Sit down before you hurt yourself, Juneau. I'll handle this.#br#
 We were hunting in Crescent Cape, as per our orders, when we were attacked#br#
 by a massive Dragomon neither of us had ever seen before. The only thing I#br#
 know for sure is that it's NOT a native of the cape." #bS00306##M307091$Vela$4$$0$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"A massive Dragomon? In the cape? Interesting...#br#
 Perhaps I was too harsh on you. Can you remember anything it?#br#
 Appearance? Rough size? Sex?" #bS00306##M320091$Agatha$4$$1$0#

#&7$Vela##br#
"Not much. Frankly, the two of us were in too much of a panic to pay close attention.#br#
 If I had to make a comparison, I'd say it looked like a large pterosaur.#br#
 I only managed to escape by slipping through a narrow gap in the rocks.#br#
 Juneau wasn't quite as lucky—he took a few nasty hits before making it in behind me." #bS00306##M307091$Vela$2$57$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 As you're listening to Vela's story, you can't help but remember back to#br#
 your tangle with that giant Dragomon during your evaluation. In fact, the#br#
 Dragomon she just described sounds eerily familiar to the one in your memories.#bS00306##char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"Hmm... can you remember where you were first attacked, perhaps?#br#
 We'll need to perform a thorough investigation of the area if we're to put a stop#br#
 to this thing. Think of the repercussions if it ate a civilian or two!" #bS00306##M320091$Agatha$821$$1$0#

#&7$Vela##br#
"Let me think... ah! I do, I do. Here, give me a map,#br#
 and I'll mark the spot where it first appeared."#br#
 Vela makes a small black X on a spot in Crescent Cape before handing it back. #bS00306##M307091$Vela$822$$0$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"Excellent. Come along, then, %n%. We've no time to lose.#br#
 Meet me over at Crescent Cape, but be mindful of your step...#br#
 If we can corner this thing without alerting it to our presence,#br# we'll save ourselves a lot of time and effort."
   #bS00306##M320091$Agatha$4$$1$0#|
10277|#&7$Agatha##br#
"What?! Bain! What are you doing here?!"#br#
 Agatha doesn't seem at all happy to see Falcon's boy wonder. #bS00403##M320091$Agatha$4$$0$0#

#&7$Bain##br#
"Hunting..."#br#
 Bain himself seems unfazed by Agatha's belligerent tone—and by what's#br#
 just transpired with the wyvern. He shrugs, face blank.#bS00403##M310091$Bain$1$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Happy to see the man who's been speaking so highly of you again, you walk over#br#
 with an amiable wave of your hand. Bain—somewhat confused, at first—glances#br#
 at Agatha and then back at you. His frigid features melt into a soft smile.#bS00403##char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"Yeah, like THAT'S not obvious, but I wasn't asking THAT. What are you#br#
 doing HERE? On MY turf?! Don't you have a hapless civilian to rescue or something?#br#
 I had things completely under control before YOUR unnecessary arrival."   #bS00403##M320091$Agatha$825$55$0$0#

#&7$Bain##br#
Bain's eyebrow rises a centimeter, and he seems to be ruminating on something#br#
 in his head. Finally, his lips curl upwards in a strangely goading smirk.#br#
"Shall we make a game of it?" You find yourself drawn to his calm confidence.
   #bS00403##M310091$Bain$821$$1$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"A 'game?' Heh. Sure! I'll play a GAME with you, pretty boy. Loser has to do#br#
 whatever the winner says for a whole day! I hope you're prepared for the#br#
 worst—I've already got a few doozies in mind." The sadistic gleam in Agatha's#br#
 eyes sends a chill all the way up to the base of your skull. #bS00403##M320091$Agatha$4$55$0$0#

#&7$Bain##br#
"Deal." Bain doesn't even flinch. Instead, he turns his gaze back to you, face softening. #br#
 "Keep it up, %n%. Remember, I'm always here if you need me."#br#
You feel your face grow warm.  
   #bS00403##M310091$Bain$822$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You quickly nod, thanking him for his concern.#br#
 Then, sheathing his sword, he turns to leave without another word.#br#
 Once the silence returns, you realize you have no idea why Agatha is so riled by him#br#
 in the first place. You glance over to see her glaring daggers at his retreating form.#bS00403##char$$822$$0$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"That priss-faced, fancy pants, pretty boy thinks he can beat ME?#br#
 He makes me so MAD! I'll wipe that smug little grin off his face, heh.#br#
 I'll wipe it off REAL good..." Agatha grips and re-grips her swords. #bS00403##M320091$Agatha$1$55$1$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"Come on, %n%! You heard the prima donna! It's a game!#br#
 And we can't let ourselves LOSE, can we?#br#
 We've gotta find out where that wyvern came from before Bain does.#br#
 Slow me down and you're out on your keister—you got that?" #bS00403##M320091$Agatha$4$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You nod vigorously, snapping to attention lest she question your commitment.#br#
 You have no idea what's going on between the two of them, but you'd#br#RATHER not get yourself in the middle of a cockfight...#bS00403##char$$806$$0$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"Excellent. Let's get back to the nest, then.#br#
 On the double! Move! Move! Move!"#br#
 Not needing to be told twice, you hop into a jog#br#and take off in the direction of Elysium. #bS00403##M320091$Agatha$821$$1$0#|
10280|Angel was finally able to get in contact with the Alchemic Order, but the idiosyncratic tendencies of this underground society are delaying progress. Bloody alchemists!

"As it just so turns out, I've finally gotten in contact with our elusive ladies and gents#br#

#&7$%n%##br#
 As strange an idea as it is, you're instantly reminded of Atelia's somewhat...#br#
 unconventional modus vivendi, and suddenly it all starts to make sense.#br#
 Alchemists must just be their own special breed.#char$$826$$0$0#

 You watch Angel tug on his hair in frustration, half-afraid he's going to turn out#br#
 like Mholt before long. Hoping to save his luscious locks, you quickly step over#br#
 to offer your assistance. You're not sure how much help you could be,#br#
 but you'd be happy to help if you could!#char$$821$$0$0#|
10290|Good news! The Alchemic Order has agreed to analyze Atelia's map! Bad news! It will take them a little while to work through the teeming mass of numbers and formulae.

Angel is, of course, more than happy to have you complete a few more assignments for him in the meantime...|
10291|#&7$Angel##br#
"Anyway, I've gone over their reply. Most of it was a bunch of mumbo jumbo#br#
 that didn't seem to have a point, but the important thing is that they agreed#br#
 to help decipher the information! Chalk one up for teamwork!" #M308060$Angel$4$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You feel your heart soar as tears spring to the corners of your eyes.#br#
 Finally! After all this work! Things seem to be coming together!#br#
 Now you'll be able to find that Crocargot, and, and stop the corruption#br#from spreading and, and Agatha's mood might even brighten!#char$$821$$0$0#

#&7$Angel##br#
"Course, that doesn't mean they'll be able to slap a translation down on our#br#
 desk Monday morning, so to speak. They'll need some time to analyze the#br#
 numbers and figures and give us a thorough breakdown—and that's not taking#br#
 into account time lost due to dragging feet."  #M308060$Angel$826$56$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Well, you always knew this was going to be a bit of a doozy. Even Atelia#br#
 had mentioned how complex the mass of algorithms and formulae was!#br#
 It looks like you'll have to wait just a little bit longer.#char$$826$$0$0#

#&7$Angel##br#
"You know what that means, don'tcha kid? Thaaaaat's right!#br#
 I mean, really, I'm doing you a favor! Giving you all these assignments#br#
 so you can train that little hunter's instinct of yours. You should be#br#
 thanking me!" Angel lets out a hearty guffaw and slaps you on the back.  #M308060$Angel$824$51$1$0#|
10292|#&7$Agatha##br#
"%n% better not be asleep on the job again...#br#
 Do they have that map deciphered YET?!#br#
 Bah. I should have just taken care of this myself."#br# You back away before Agatha realizes you're there... #M320090$Agatha$825$55$1$0#|
10293|#&7$Agatha##br#
"%n%! THERE you are! Have you gotten that map decipher y—"#br#
 She notices the folder in your hand and grabs it instantly, unfolding#br#the map inside. #M320090$Agatha$4$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 When Agatha's eyes rove the contents uncertainly, you quickly step forward#br#
 to point out the circle to the northwest—the location of the Primordial Crocargot!#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"Yes...! YES!! Finally! I knew Angel would pull through—I just KNEW IT!#br# This is-... this is everything we need, then! We know where it is, we know#br#
 how to catch it! We can hunt that mutant son of a snail down!"#br#
 Agatha's eyes grow wild as a sadistic chuckle builds in the back of her throat. #M320090$Agatha$824$51$1$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
Before you completely lose her to whatever twisted fantasy has captured her#br#
 imagination, you stealthily push the letter with Angel's recommendation#br#under her nose. She blinks, eyes refocusing, then glances through it. #M320090$Agatha$4$$1$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"Hmm... seems you really impressed the good chairman. Solid performance,#br#
 %n%! But now is not the time! We have more important things to worry#br#about than whether or not you go up a pay grade."#M320090$Agatha$821$$1$0#

#&7$Delphia##br#
"I should be able to handle the arrangements, Agatha. It's no problem.#br#
 Part of my duty as secretary, after all." Delphia's soft voice interrupts the two#br#
 of you, and you glance over to see her walking towards you. #M327090$Delphia$822$$0$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"Be my guest, then. Promote him. Promote everyone!#br#
 I, on the other hand, have some vital groundwork to set in motion."#br#
 Agatha tosses Delphia your recommendation letter with a flippant flick of#br#her hand, then goes immediately back to studying the map. #M320090$Agatha$4$51$1$0#|
10294|#&7$%n%##br#
 A few more assignments under your belt and what you believe to be an adequate#br#
 amount of time having passed, you head on back to the Hunters' League HQ to#br#
 speak with Angel regarding the progress of that oh-so-exasperating map.#char$$821$$0$0#

#&7$Angel##br#
"Hey! Ahaha, I kid—we don't have pigeons. Anyway, I've finally... FINALLY gotten that#br#
 map of yours back from the Alchemic Order. Did I tell you I'd get it done or#br#did I tell you I'd get it done?!" #M308060$Angel$4$$1$0#

#&7$Angel##br#
"Rest your oculus specs on this pretty painting! It's a genuine map of our very#br#
 own Primeval Marsh... with the location of that Dragomon of yours pinpointed#br# 
 down to the cubic foot!"#br#
 Angel zealously pokes his finger on a red circle to the northwest. #M308060$Angel$821$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 This... this is better than you could have hoped for! You have no idea how those#br#
 alchemists could have turned that jumble of numbers into such a perfectly readable,#br#
 easy-to-understand map, but you're eternally grateful! You zealously thank the chairman.#char$$821$$0$0#

#&7$Angel##br#
"Bwahaha, no, no, no! Was my pleasure, dear %n%.#br#
 After all, we in the Hunters' League would do anything for our Falcon compatriots!#br#
 And, well, you DID sure help us out with a lot of those assignments..."#br#
 Angel grins sheepishly, scratching the back of his head. #M308060$Angel$822$51$1$0#

#&7$Angel##br#
"Oh, and before I forget—I'm gonna recommend you for a #&46$promotion#. Now, now,#br# don't get all goopy-eyed—you deserve it! You really impressed me with all that work#br#
 you put in these past days. I've got it all written up in this folder, so take it to Agatha#br#
 for me, would you?" He hands you said folder along with the deciphered map.
    #M308060$Angel$4$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 A promotion, too?! The good news just doesn't stop! Must be a red letter day.#br#
 You cheerily take the offered items, thank the chairman again (even more graciously#br# 
 this time), then shove off in the direction of the Falcon's Nest. You can't wait to tell#br#Agatha the good news!#char$$822$$0$0#|
10300|Though you're still in the dark regarding Agatha and Bain's inimical relationship, Agatha's already at work attempting to solve the mystery behind the wyvern in Crescent Cape.

After investigating its corpse, she discovered scales from what she believes to be Raptites, and—thinking a more thorough analysis could lead to a clue—she asks that you collect a few tissue samples from these reptilian fiends. Guess you're headed back to the cape! At least you've got the weather on your side?|
10301|#&7$Agatha##br#
"Using these samples and some good old common sense, we should be able to make an#br#
 educated guess as to where the rest of these wyverns are holed up. This scale, for instance,#br#
 originally belonged to some sort of lizard-like Dragomon, the closest of which would#br#
 be those #&46$Raptites# that proliferate at Crescent Cape."  #M320090$Agatha$4$$1$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"If we don't do something quickly, the wyverns are liable to keep multiplying—and you#br#
 can only guess the consequences of THAT. Leave the big brutes to me, though.#br#
 YOU, I want to head over to Crescent Cape and collect a few #&46$tissue samples##br#
 from those #&46$Raptites#. We need more info to narrow in on those dragon pigs." #M320090$Agatha$1$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You give her a crisp salute, ready to head out for some raptor-dissection, but#br#
 just as you're about to turn on your heels, Agatha stops you.#char$$806$$0$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"One last thing! Stop by #&46$Calixia the herbalist# on your way, will you?#br#
 I dropped a plant sample off at her place earlier, but she should be done with #br#
 it relatively soon. Just tell her I sent you, and she should give you the results. #br#
 No dawdling—you hear me?"  #M320090$Agatha$4$$1$0#|
10302|#&7$Agatha##br#
"Back already? Why do I get the feeling you haven't even left yet?#br#
 Get out there, rook! I haven't got all day!"#br#
 Agatha points towards the nearby gearcopter, voice rising sharply. #M320090$Agatha$4$$1$0#|
10303|#&7$%n%##br#
 You report your findings to Agatha—the Raptite tissue samples you#br#
 collected, Calixia's lack of interest in her plant sample analysis,#br#
 and also the fact that you've found no trace of any wyverns during#br#
 your investigation of the cape.#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"Hmm... interesting. If I had to guess, I'd say they're in the middle of an off-season#br#
 migration—but why? It's almost as though something's got them on the run.#br#
 I'm worried that if we don't get them to move on soon, well... you can imagine."#M320090$Agatha$4$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
 Agatha falls once more into deep thought, her eyes losing their focus.#br#
 As you wait for her to return to reality, you feel a tiny tug on your sleeve.#br#
 You glance down and see %p%'s big brown eyes staring up at you.#pets100+30$$4$$1$0#|
10304|#&7$Calixia##br#
"My, my! Yours is not a face I've seen before.#br#
 Anything I can help you with, dear?#br#
 Perhaps you're here for one of my famous love potions? Ohoho..." #M332020$Calixia$824$51$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You shake your head, explaining that you're simply here about the sample Agatha had#br#
 entrusted her with. Calixia's expression falls, and she lets out a dispassionate sigh.#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Calixia##br#
"Is that all? Young people! No one's interested in a little innocent voodoo anymore.#br#
 I've already tested that sample she brought me—nothing exciting, let me assure you.#br#
 I'm not sure what she was all keyed up about. Here I'd been hoping for something#br#
 far more scandalous! This gossip drought has left me positively SPIRITless...#M332020$Calixia$2$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 She hands you a write-up of her analysis with a flippant flick of her wrist.#br#
 You accept it with a polite thank you.#char$$822$$0$0#

#&7$Calixia##br#
"This tedium is draining my very soul. Nothing but the same thing day in and day out.#br#
 If you happen upon anything of interest—or SCANDalous—do let me know?#br#
 I'd be glad to help you analyze the situation..." #M332020$Calixia$1$$1$0#|
10310|Your wyvern investigation hits a standstill until your companion mentions something strange they'd noticed while you were out collecting tissue samples—all the nearby Dragomon had seemed terrified of something!

Thinking this could be just the clue you need, Agatha sends you off to bag a few Clamcrack Otters from the area while she consults one of the guild's specialists. Ensnaring frightened, innocent animals? Your specialty!|
10311|#&7$Agatha##br#
"Your companion clearly has something to say, %n%."#br#
 Agatha's eyes snap back into focus, and she nods her head towards %p%.
   #M320090$Agatha$4$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You give %p% a little scritch behind their ears and ask what it is#br#
 that's just popped into their head. You're rewarded with a broad smile.#pets100+30$$4$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"I don't know if it means much, but, but, but! When we were collecting those samples#br#
 from the Raptites in the cape, I noticed that a lot of the other Dragomon were#br#
 hiding or acting really skittish. I remember thinking it was odd..."#pets100+30$$3$$1$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"That WOULD be odd. I can imagine they'd remain a bit fearful right after#br#
 the attack, but it's been long enough now that their fear should have subsided.#br#
 This could be some sort of clue."#br#
 Agatha rubs her chin, eyes narrowed, then reaches behind her and pulls out a #&46$large sack#. #M320090$Agatha$1$$1$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"Those #&46$Clamcrack Otters# are the most plentiful over there, #br#
 and they should be easy to catch, too. This could be our big break, %n%! #br#
 Go catch a few—#&46$the more terrified, the better#—while I consult#br# 
 a specialist I know on the matter. Don't screw this up for me!" #M320090$Agatha$4$$1$0#|
10312|#&7$Agatha##br#
"Have you caught those otters yet?#br#
 Little runts get scared so easily, but they tend to forget just as fast.#br#
 That's why it's odd that they'd still be in hiding..." #M320090$Agatha$4$$1$0#|
10313|#&7$%n%##br#
 Upon arriving back in Elysium, you take off immediately for Agatha,#br#
 handing over the sack of Clamcrack Otters you captured in the cape.#br#
 Agatha peers into the sack, chewing on the inside of her cheek thoughtfully.#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"No doubt about it—these otters have caught a major case of heebie-jeebies. #br#
 But not from any wyvern. No... this is different. Blast! For a Dragomon with #br#
 this kind of power to be wandering unchecked this close to the city..."#br#
 Agatha's brows furrow, her eyes growing cloudy. #M320090$Agatha$4$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Seeing the great Agatha so concerned makes your own stomach do#br#
 a few flip-flops. You're also not exactly sure what she's talking about.#br#
 You ask her what she means by a "Dragomon with that kind of power."#char$$826$$0$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"You've got the typical, weak Dragomon you can find just about anywhere, and then#br#
 you've got the big kahunas—rare Dragomon with uncanny levels of power. These#br#
 brutes tend to give off threatening auras that can affect other Dragomon and weak-willed#br#
 humans, and all the evidence suggests that's exactly what we've got on our hands now..." #M320090$Agatha$821$$1$0#|
10320|Agatha deduces that the Clamcrack Otters must have been affected by the aura of an incredibly powerful Dragomon—one that can't be left alive, that's for sure! 

If this Dragomon is allowed to continue terrorizing the nearby cape, it could force more Dragomon out of their homes, severely damaging the ecology (and don't even go into the number of civilians it might gobble up!). Delphia suggests the two of you ask for support from some of your fellow Falcons, and first up on the list is a somewhat eccentric-sounding bloke named Nash...|
10321|#&7$Agatha##br#
"It's all starting to make sense. It'd take a pretty big baddie to scare WYVERNS off.#br# I don't even care about Bain anymore—what's more important is taking this#br#
 thing out before it does any more damage, and I'm not just talking about an attack.#br#
 This thing could seriously affect the ecology if it keeps forcing other Dragomon to migrate!"
   #M320090$Agatha$4$$1$0#

#&7$Delphia##br#
"Indeed. If it continues to attract other large Dragomon to the area, things could grow#br#
 quite dire!" You and Agatha turn around with a start to see Delphia listening in not more#br#
 than a few steps away. "Might you try asking some of the other Falcon elite for help?#br#
 I believe #&46$Nash# is currently on assignment in Crescent Bay. He could be of assistance." #M327090$Delphia$4$$0$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"Probably a good idea, I suppose. %n%, you go find Nash.#br#
 Talking to that guy pisses me off. I'll go see if a few of the other#br#
 guys would be willing to lend a hand as well." #M320090$Agatha$821$$1$0#

#&7$Delphia##br#
"He shouldn't be too hard to find. Just look for a large group of #&46$Raptites#. Nash's#br#
 idea of hunting typically involves luring all his prey into one central location, enabling#br#
 him to take them all out in one fell swoop using his... what was it he called it again?#br#
 'Dactylic Augury of Legendary Proportions?' So... find the Raptites, and you find Nash." #M327090$Delphia$821$$0$0#|
10322|#&7$Agatha##br#
"He's the most narcissist princess you'll ever meet, and you'll probably#br#
 wanna clock him upside the jaw as soon as you see him, but he's a skilled#br#
 mage beneath all that self-aggrandizing mumbo jumbo he spits out." #M320090$Agatha$4$$1$0#|
10323|#&7$%n%##br#
 You return to Elysium to find Van Pelt and several of the other elite Falcons#br#
 furtively discussing something within the Falcon's Nest.
 #char$$2$$0$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
 Agatha glances back and spies you, motioning for you to stay where you#br#
 are for a moment. You obediently wait by the steps for the group to finish#br#
 their strategic meeting, wondering what they're talking about... #M320090$Agatha$4$$1$0#|
10325|#&7$%n%##br#
 Your head is spinning as you get to your feet, a bit unsure as to what just transpired.#br#
 Once you've recollected yourself, you explain to Nash that the rest of the Falcons#br#are in need of his assistance.#bS00403##char$$821$$0$0#

#&7$Nash##br#
"Just as I had suspected! My sixth sense is NEVER wrong, after all. I'd had the faintest#br#
 sensation that something was amiss back in the nest, and now here you are, informing#br#
 me of exactly that. My genius truly exceeds even my own expectations at times."#br#
 Nash exuberantly runs a hand through his bangs, chuckling to himself. #bS00403##M322090$Nash$821$$1$0#

#&7$Nash##br#
"You'll have to give me a moment, however, as I've yet to complete my task here.#br#
 Why don't you run on back to HQ, and I'll meet with you there shortly.#br#
 I trust you can still use those legs of yours, yes? No significant damage?"#br#
 Nash gives you a thorough once-over, one eyebrow raised in readily-apparent skepticism. #bS00403##M322090$Nash$4$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Despite the lingering pain in your right foot, you assure him that you're perfectly#br#
 fine. Masking the limp in your step, you take off for the Falcon's Nest to let#br#
 #&46$Agatha# know you've done your duty.#bS00403##char$$806$$0$0#|
10330|After finding Nash in the cape, you hurry back to the Falcon's Nest to report to Agatha, but find her and the rest of the Falcon elite already in fervent discussion regarding the current situation.

Van Pelt assigns each of them a different task to speed along your efforts, but seems to have forgotten one certain hotheaded purplette...|
10331|#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"That beast is our number one priority right now. Your other assignments#br#
 can take a backseat until we get this thing under control. Initial analysis has#br#
 identified the critter as a giant dragon—most likely a subspecies of wyvern.#br#
 From here on out, we'll refer to it as #&46$Gerardus#." #M330090$Van Pelt$4$$1$0#

#&7$Nash##br#
"I don't know what you're ALL up in arms about. Simply give me the brunt#br#
 of the work! I'm sure I could fell the beast with ease, and I've been SO starved#br#
 for a challenge as of late. I feel positively underutilized!" Nash hems and#br#
 haws, one hand on his hip as the other curls upwards in flippant apathy. #M322090$Nash$821$$0$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"Could we try and limit chatter to actually productive suggestions?"#br#
 Agatha rolls her eyes, patience already well past its limits. #M320090$Agatha$4$$0$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"I've already decided to assign Bain to recon. I had him do some previous#br#
 investigation into this matter, so he'd be our smartest choice to send back#br#
 out into the field. Once we narrow in on this big lug, we can start formulating#br#
 a strategy for taking him down." Van Pelt completely ignores Nash's comment. #M330090$Van Pelt$4$$1$0#

#&7$Bain##br#
"No game?"#br#
 Bain turns to Agatha, a tiny smile gracing his features. #M310090$Bain$4$$1$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"Yeah, no game! There's too many people involved, now.#br#
 But whatever. You should just be glad you won't have to face#br#
 the crushing humiliating of losing to me once and for all.#br#
 Still, it's only a matter of time..." #M320090$Agatha$4$55$0$0#

#&7$Bain##br#
Bain chuckles beneath his breath.#br#
 You can't tell if it's forced or genuine. #M310090$Bain$1$$1$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"Guys like you REALLY make me angry, you know that?#br#
 Someday... SOMEday..."#br#
 Agatha's voice hisses between her clenched teeth. #M320090$Agatha$825$55$0$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"Let's keep on track, people! Come on!#br#
 Garth? Where are ya, Garth? We're gonna need some of your#br# most excellent traps to get this thing good and cornered.#br#
 Think you can whip us up a few whizbangers?" #M330090$Van Pelt$4$$1$0#

#&7$Garth##br#
"I'll whip 'em up and more! Especially if it means more funding.#br# Got myself a few new promising prototypes that have had to#br#
 simmer on the back boiler due to lack of funds."#br#
 Garth gleefully rubs his hands together, rough voice practically cracking in excitement.
   #M329090$Garth$3$54$0$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"As for keeping the area cleared of prying eyes and mons, I'll leave#br#
 that to you, Nash. Think you can handle that? We'll need a pretty wide#br#
 breadth given the size of our target. I wanna make sure nothing and#br#
 no one else gets hurt in the process." #M330090$Van Pelt$1$$1$0#

#&7$Nash##br#
"Is that all? Consider it done!#br#
 Not even the tiniest flea could get in under my watch."#br#
 Nash lifts one arm upwards in an elegant bow.
   #M322090$Nash$4$$0$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"And as for you, Delphia, could I ask you to keep everything under#br#
 control back here at HQ? We've yet to find a suitable reception candidate,#br#

#&7$Delphia##br#
"I would be more than happy to—I do so enjoy conversing with everyone,#br#
 after all, and I can keep my eyes open for possible candidates, as well." #M327090$Delphia$822$$0$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"Excellent! Well then, team? Shall we get to work? Let's try and—"#br# Van Pelt's parting thoughts get cut off by a curt remark from Agatha.
   #M330090$Van Pelt$824$54$1$0#|
10332|...|
10333|#&7$Agatha##br#
"And just WHY is it that I've been overlooked... AGAIN?#br#
 I would really, really LOVE to know, Pelt..."#br#
 You can practically feel the barely-contained acrimony#br#
 radiating from Agatha's trembling figure. #M320090$Agatha$4$$1$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"Er, um, of course! I mean, you're still training %n%, right?#br#
 That's a very important job! Gotta make sure the tyke can handle assignments#br#
 on their own, yeah? As soon as you think they're ready to kick it solo, I'll#br#
 assign you something straightaway!" Van Pelt looks about ready to wet himself. #M330090$Van Pelt$826$56$1$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
 Agatha shoots you a look that makes your nasal cavity go up in flames.#br#
 She sighs not at all inconspicuously and turns back to Van Pelt. #M320090$Agatha$3$55$0$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"Fine. Whatever.#br#
 But mark my words, Pelt... you'd better#br#
 follow through or there'll be hell to pay." #M320090$Agatha$4$$0$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"Of course, of course! When have I ever lied?"#br#
 Van Pelt chuckles nervously and throws a despondent glance back at Bain.#br#
"Now, uh... right! Off you go, people! Everyone to their tasks.#br#
 Let's see if we can nip this drago-dilemma in the bud." #M330090$Van Pelt$4$51$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Once Van Pelt finishes speaking, the group disperses, each of them heading off#br#
 to start on their respective assignments. Bain shoots you a charming smile#br#
 on his way out, and you respond with a bashful wave of your own.#char$$822$$0$0#

"Oh, %n%! Theeeeere you are. Shall we continue your TRAINING?"#br#
 
   #M320090$Agatha$4$$1$0#|
10340|Agatha seems none too happy about resuming your training, but neither of you have much of a choice in the matter.

 Pick that up for me on your way, will you? Just tell her you're there#br#
 for my order. It's already paid for and everything." #M320090$Agatha$4$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
 You nod—thankful to get away for a bit and not have to deal with Agatha's#br#
 residual rage—though you do ask her what she needs the rope for.#char$$806$$0$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"What is this? Twenty questions?! It doesn't matter, just get it for me!#br#
 And stop lollygagging. I'm not training you to stand around like a#br#
 monkey with its legs chopped off!"#br#Agatha's voice rises sharply, and you instinctively wince.#M320090$Agatha$1$$1$0#|
10342|#&7$Agatha##br#
"What are you doing back here empty-handed?#br#
 I thought I was being very CLEAR when I told#br#you to get your butt in gear!!" #M320090$Agatha$4$$1$0#|
10343|#&7$%n%##br#
 You return to the Falcon's Nest with the requested items in tow#br#
 to find Agatha in the middle of a conversation with Gearmaster Garth,#br#
 the blonde, oil-smudged mechanist you met earlier at the meeting.#char$$2$$0$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"Ugh, FINALLY. Took you long enough!#br#
 Garth here's been waiting for you for HOURS." #M320090$Agatha$4$$1$0#

#&7$Garth##br#
"Exaggerate a little more, why don't you, eh, Agatha?#br#
 Put 'er there, kid. You must be that new sprocket Bain mentioned to me, yeah?#br#
 Not often a rook comes around that impresses that bag of bolts." Garth grabs#br#
 your hand in his great, big palm and gives it a series of shakes that rattle your teeth. #M329090$Garth$4$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You shake your head to find your bearings, then introduce yourself to#br#
 Garth. He seems satisfied with your reply and slaps your back with a hearty guffaw.#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Garth##br#
"And mannerly, to boot! I like you already, %n%.#br#
 Why don't you let me learn the kid up on making traps, Agatha.#br#
 After all, experience is the best teacher! A few tips from me and#br#
 they'll be making traps like who laid the chunk!" #M329090$Garth$1$$1$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"Fair enough. I leave %n% in your capable hands, then, Garth.#br#
 Glad to know I can trust SOMEone around here to do their JOB." #M320090$Agatha$4$$0$0#

#&7$Garth##br#
"Pelt means well, really. He's just not good at, well, dealing#br#
 with the LITTLE things. You should give the guy a break.#br#
 Lord knows, he could use one right about now." #M329090$Garth$821$$1$0#|
10344|#&7$Rita##br#
"Good day to you, hunter.#br#
 Is there something I can do for you?#br#
 Perhaps you're in search of something in particular?" #M041030$Rita$822$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You tell Rita that you've simply come to collect the rope Agatha ordered. Rita pauses#br#
 in thought for a moment, then remembers and begins rifling through a box of goods#br#
 behind her. She turns back with the rope in hand, handing it to you with a smile.#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Rita##br#
"If you're running errands for Agatha, you must be that new, young hunter everyone's#br#
 talking about, yes? A number of other hunters who've dropped by have mentioned#br#
 your name. Training under Agatha must be quite the endeavor, I would assume,#br#
 but if there's anyone who could handle her, I'm sure it would be you." #M041030$Rita$4$$1$0#|
10350|Upon returning to Agatha with the requested lumber and meat, you're introduced to the neighborhood trapper 'n cogsmith, Garth, who seems keen on teaching you a thing or two about the trapping business.

Ever the enthusiastic student, you couldn't be more excited! Meet him over in Cain's Glade to get the lesson started.|
10351|#&7$Garth##br#
"Aww yiss! Let's get this steam train a chug-chuggin', shall we? We'll head #br#
 over to Cain's Glade so I can teach you how to lay #&46$fine-quality traps#.#br#
 We'll need to have them all set and ready to go before Pelt and the#br#
 others try to #&46$sniff out ol' Gerardus."# #M329090$Garth$4$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You nod your head enthusiastically, curious to see what constitutes a "fine-quality#br#
 trap" (and what this whole trapping business is about in the first place!).#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"Keep your eyes peeled for any signs of our drago while you're out there.#br#
 You notice ANYthing, you report back here immediately, got it?#br#
 No heroics or misguided acts of grandeur. You scare that thing off, and we'll#br#
 be lucky to find it again, let alone take it out. #M320090$Agatha$4$$1$0#|
10352|#&7$Agatha##br#
"What're you still doing here? Garth already left for Cain's Glade!#br#
 The guy's doing you a favor, so stop dawdling and get over there!" #M320090$Agatha$4$$1$0#|
10353|#&7$%n%##br#
 You make your way back to the Falcon's Nest and find Agatha where you'd#br#
 left her, filling her in on the results of your trap-laying. She chews on the#br#
 inside of her cheek, eyes narrowing.#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"You already ran into it, then, huh? Cripes, and it sounds like a real beast, too.#br#
 Garth's traps are top-notch! I'll have to let Pelt and the others know that it's #br#
 already on the move. I only hope that Garth can buy us a bit more time..."#M320090$Agatha$4$$1$0#|
10360|Gerardus was too much for even genius trapper Garth's traps! Looks like you're going to need to up the ante to slow down this colossal titan.

A poison-tipped trap might do the trick, but for that, you're going to need venom from the Toxroaches in Cain's Woods. Like always, it's up to you to do the dirty work. Nab some of that venom! But don't get poked yourself...|
10361|#&7$Agatha##br#
"All right, %n%. We don't have a lot of time if we have any hopes of catching#br#
 this thug. If Garth is wanting to make a better trap, he'll need #&46$venom##br#
 strong enough to immobilize a dragon. #&46$Toxroach venom# should#br#
 probably do the trick... Go get some! You'll find Toxroaches all over Cain's Woods." #M320090$Agatha$4$$1$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"Be mindful of their mandibles when collecting the venom. Those things#br#
 puncture skin, and you'll be down and out faster than Pelt at the first sign#br#
 of responsibility. So long as you're careful, though, you should be fine."#br#
 Agatha doesn't seem all too concerned about your safety, but what else is new? #M320090$Agatha$821$$1$0#|
10362|#&7$Agatha##br#
"You can find Toxroaches all over Cain's Woods. You shouldn't have any trouble#br#
 nabbing a few. The difficult part is extracting the venom. Just... don't put your hand#br#
 within a few feet of its jaws and you should be fine. Piece of cake."#br#
 Agatha's lack of concern mildly alarms you. #M320090$Agatha$4$$1$0#|
10363|#&7$%n%##br#
 You head back to Agatha, vials of venom in tow (and feeling rather proud#br#
 of yourself, to be quite honest). Agatha, surprisingly enough, seems in a good#br#
 mood. In fact, there's even the glimmer of a smile gracing her features. You're#br#
 unsure if this is a good thing or a bad thing.#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"Perfect—you're back. Get ready to head out! Our preparations are#br#
 nearly complete, which means it's time to hunt this bad boy down."#br#
 Agatha grabs the vials from your hands, giving them a quick#br#
 glance before shoving them in her pocket. #M320090$Agatha$821$51$1$0#|
10370|You bring back the Toxroach venom just in time for Agatha to inform you that the hunt's about to begin! Sink or swim, Gerardus must be taken out.

Your first major hunt! Together with the Falcon elite, no less! Your heart feels about ready to palpitate its way out of your chest. You can only hope you'll do your fellow Falcons right...|
10371|#&7$Agatha##br#
"Latest intel on our new friend Gerardus paints a sinister picture, indeed.#br#
 Seems this lovable critter even attacks its own kind, which explains why all#br#
 those other wyverns were on the run. We've got ourselves a sadistic little#br#
 bloodthirsty chomp-and-run, it would seem. Heh." #M320090$Agatha$821$$1$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"I can only imagine how big the chunk of #&46$Dragocite# it's carrying must be!#br#
 There's no way we can let this chance slip us by. C'mon—let's go regroup with#br#
 Pelt and the others. They should be heading out soon." #M320090$Agatha$4$$1$0#|
10372|#&7$Delphia##br#
"How goes the hunt, dear?#br#
 I do hope everything went smoothly."#br#
 Delphia smiles at you warmly. #M327090$Delphia$4$$1$0#|
10373|#&7$%n%##br#
 Upon arriving back in Elysium, you quickly head over to Delphia, anxious#br#
 to learn all about this giant chunk of rock in your hand. You fill her in on the#br#
 results of your hunt and show her the piece of Dragocite you were given.#char$$1$$0$0#

#&7$Delphia##br#
"I'm so happy to hear that things went well! I'm sure#br#
 you're quite exhausted now after all that excitement.#br#
 Ah, and before I forget—congratulations, %n%!"#M327090$Delphia$821$51$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You're at a loss, at first, unsure as to why Delphia congratulated you.#br#
 When Delphia notices you blinking owlishly, she smiles and explains.#char$$4$$0$0#
  

#&7$Delphia##br#
"This was your very first hunt! All Falcons must participate in an official hunt upon#br#
 being approved by Chairman Angel. Think of it as a way of consummating your#br#
 Falcon membership. That Dragocite in your hands is proof that you've successfully#br#
 completed your first hunt... and the requirement for your first promotion!" #M327090$Delphia$4$51$1$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"Yeah, yeah, well... don't let it get to your head. You've still#br#
 got a lot to learn, and you'd do well to remember that."#br#
 Agatha seems unimpressed by this news. #M320090$Agatha$4$$1$0#

#&7$Delphia##br#
"Oh, Agatha. You shouldn't be so harsh! %n% has shown true prowess#br#
 and dedication today. Why, if they keep this up, they'll soon be a higher#br#
 rank than me! If only all our recruits could be this passionate." #M327090$Delphia$1$$1$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"Meh."#br#
 Agatha remains unmoved. Somehow, though, you know that deep,#br#
 deep, deep, DEEP down inside, she's impressed with your progress. #M320090$Agatha$1$$1$0#|
10375|#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"Whew! Did that get your blood pumping, or did THAT get your BLOOD pumping?!#br#
 Couldn't have planned it better! Heh, it was almost TOO easy. Almost wish it could#br#
 have gone on a little longer, but, well, beggars can't be choosers."#br#
 Van Pelt claps you on the back with a hearty guffaw. #bS00802##M330090$Van Pelt$4$54$1$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"Right? Seems like it was already worn down—probably from some bout or#br#
 what-have-you with another Dragomon. Here I was hoping for a chance to really kick#br#
 the adrenaline into high-gear, but it was practically over before it even started."#br#
 Agatha fiddles with her swords, visibly restless. #bS00802##M320090$Agatha$3$$0$0#

#&7$Garth##br#
"Bah, who cares? So long as we took that big chameleon out, yeah? And so long as#br#
 I get my reward of course, ohoho! You find yourself going up against any other#br#
 beasties in the near future, Pelt, and you can count me in!" #bS00802##M329090$Garth$2$54$0$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"Do those beasties include women? Because I certainly find myself#br#
 going up against a lot of those, BWAHAHA!"#br#
 Pelt and Garth burst into laughter.#br#
 Agatha rolls her eyes, thoroughly done with both of them. #bS00802##M330090$Van Pelt$824$54$1$0#

#&7$Bain##br#
"The Dragocite..."#br#
 Bain scrounges around Gerardus's corpse, hand returning with a brilliant,#br#
 crystal-like shard. Everyone gathers around to get a closer look. #bS00802##M310090$Bain$1$$0$0#

#&7$Nash##br#
"Is that all? Here I'd been hoping for something of quality.#br#
 This useless rock is barely above mid-grade!"#br#
 Nash runs a hand through his bangs, hip cocked out in apathetic disregard.
   #bS00802##M322090$Nash$4$$1$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"Huh. He's right for once—this thing'd be pretty useless for any of us.#br#
 Why don't we let %n% keep it? Would do them more good."#br#
 Agatha gives the chunk of Dragocite a rap with her knuckles#br#before turning back around. #bS00802##M320090$Agatha$821$$1$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"Good idea. They did deal the final blow, after all. Seems like a fitting reward.#br#
 Here you are, %n%! Your very own piece of Dragocite! If you take it back to#br#
 #&46$Delphia# in the nest, she'll fill you in on what you can do with it, yeah?#br#
 An up-and-coming rook like you should have no trouble making good use of it." #bS00802##M330090$Van Pelt$4$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 A bit taken aback (but more than willing!), you take the Dragocite from Van Pelt#br#
 with a smile. Then, once you and Agatha are ready to go, you bid the rest of the#br#
 team farewell and head back to the Falcon's Nest, the bright, shiny piece of Dragocite#br#in your grubby hands.#bS00802##char$$806$$0$0#|
10380|Apparently, Van Pelt wants to see you about something else (you're still not sure why he doesn't just come talk to you directly), but he's wandered off to who-knows-where.

As you're still waiting for your promotion to be processed by HQ, Agatha suggests you take on a few more assignments to continue developing your skills. Things will only get more challenging from here on out, and you need to be ready!|
10381|#&7$Delphia##br#
"Ah, before you leave, %n%, Van had something else he wished to speak to you about,#br#
 but he had to run off somewhere. I'm actually not sure when he'll be back..." Delphia#br#
 puffs out her cheeks in befuddlement, one finger tapping her lips.#M327090$Delphia$2$$1$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"Yeah, well, %n% can't just sit around all day waiting for flighty ignoramuses#br#
 to come wandering back whenever they gosh darn please! %n%! Get out there#br#
 and accept some assignments. The league's been getting an influx of them in, anyway." #M320090$Agatha$4$$0$0#

#&7$Delphia##br#
"Hmm, we'll need a bit more time to process your promotion, as well.#br#
 Paperwork, you know—it never ends! So Agatha's proposal might not#br#
 be such a bad idea." #M327090$Delphia$821$$1$0#|
10382|#&7$Agatha##br#
"Dang straight! Remember, %n%. Most of what you've done up to this point has#br#
 been pocket change. You need to get out there and sharpen those skills for when#br#
 the first REAL challenge comes along. You slack now and you'll regret it later." #M320090$Agatha$4$$1$0#|
10383|#&7$Agatha##br#
"So, talked to Pelt yet? What did that lunkhead want?#br#
 Well, whatever!
 Back to training! You slack and it's yourself you smack!"#br#
 As harsh as Agatha's tone is, you know she has only the best intentions.#br#
 Well... you hope so, at least. #M320090$Agatha$4$$1$0#|
10384|#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"Ah, %n%! There you are, old buddy. I have to apologize 'cuz I've been absolutely  #br#
 SWAMPED lately. Haven't even had a chance to say hi, let ALONE hold any sort #br#
 of profound conversation."#br#
 Pelt certainly does seem a bit worse for the wear judging by the bags under his eyes.
   #M330090$Van Pelt$1$$1$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"...you know. Looking at you takes me back. Makes me remember when I was an#br#
 up-and-coming young gun just like you. That was the life, yeah? Just me and the open#br#
 plains. No endless piles of paperwork. No pointless bureaucratic nonsense."#br#
 He gazes off somewhere in the distance, lost in his own little world for a moment. #M330090$Van Pelt$4$$1$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"Bah, you don't have time to listen to an old fogey like me reminisce about bygone#br#
 days. Just remember this—don't ever forget why you became a Falcon in the first#br#
 place. Live your adventure to the fullest! Let us grumpy old folks take care of the#br#boring, political stuff." #M330090$Van Pelt$821$$1$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"We Falcons are like one big family. You can come to any of us about anything!#br#
 Hunting, relationships, mentally devastating emotional trauma... you name it!"#br#
 Pelt puts a burly arm around your shoulder, giving your whole body a little shake.#br#
 "Just call me 'daddy!' ...actually, on second thought, that could get a little weird." #M330090$Van Pelt$4$$1$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"Soooo... anyway! Keep up the awesome work. I know Agatha can be a bit of a handful,#br#
 but she does mean well, and she's pretty top-notch when it comes to handling a weapon.#br#
 Plus—hey! If you can put up with her, you can put up with anything! Always think on the#br#
 bright side. That's my motto! Right behind 'Disregard females. Acquire currency.'" #M330090$Van Pelt$821$$1$0#|
10390|Angel informs you that tracks of the mighty <Crystal Ursa> Quintus have recently been discovered in Seasnail Grotto.

Find yourself a worthy party and take the barnacled bear down!|
10391|#&7$Angel##br#
"%n%, you're just the hunter I was wanting to see!#br#
 The Hunters' League just received a new assignment, but it's a bit of a#br# doozy—we could use a few more hands, so to speak. Would you be interested?" #M308060$Angel$4$$1$0#

#&7$Angel##br#
"We recently uncovered tracks we believe belong to the famed <Crystal Ursa> Quintus#br#

10410|Agatha decides to teach you about typical Falcon life, but quickly rescinds that idea upon realizing it "isn't her job."

"Excellent. I'll admit—you're showing some pretty good resolve.#br#
 And that's not just lip service. I don't pander to anyone, after all.#br#
 I simply state facts. You'd do well to remember that."#br#
 Despite the (somewhat) kind words, Agatha's features remain as emotionless as ever. #M320090$Agatha$821$$1$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"Now that you're a technically a full-fledged Falcon member, I suppose I#br#

#&7$Delphia##br#
"One of the biggest perks of being a member of our distinguished union is that#br#
 we oftentimes receive quite grandiose requests—to take out rare Dragomon, for instance.#br#
 And, as you know, the more extensive the assignment, the greater the rewards." #M327090$Delphia$1$$1$0#

#&7$Delphia##br#
"As you complete more assignments, you rank within the order will increase. Higher#br#
 ranks—and more experience, of course—allow you to take on these bigger assignments.#br#
 That's why you must always continue striving to improve yourself. You don't want to#br#miss out on an assignment because you're not yet strong enough to complete it." #M327090$Delphia$4$$1$0#

#&7$Delphia##br#
"Being a young hunter is a breathtaking, exhilarating experience! Use this opportunity#br#
 to challenge yourself and rise beyond limits you never thought imaginable! It's a#br#
 little-known secret, but even Agatha and Bain were once—"#M327090$Delphia$821$51$1$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"AHEM! I think that's quite enough of Delphia's 'lectures' for one day, yes?#br# Come on, %n%, I have another job for you to do. A golden opportunity, too,#br#
 so you won't wanna miss it." Agatha appears from seemingly out of nowhere#br#
 to interrupt Delphia.#br#
   #M320090$Agatha$4$$1$0#

#&7$Delphia##br#
"Oh, dear! I suppose that means our conversation is over. But it was such#br#
 a lovely chat! Let's do it again sometime, yes? Remember, %n%—always#br#
 keep facing forward! The more effort you put into something, the greater#br#
 the return. I'll be rooting for you!" #M327090$Delphia$4$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Even Agatha and Bain were WHAT?! The possible endings to that sentence plague#br#
 your mind, but it seems today's not your day to discover the full story behind your#br#
 callous mentor and the wonder boy of the Falcons. A bit disappointed, you thank#br#Delphia for the delightful chat before jogging off to find Agatha.#char$$826$$0$0#|
10420|Not every assignment that comes in is a glorious affair, and this latest humdinger is proof of that! And now, thanks to Agatha's foul mood, she's "delegated" it to you.

One look at the list, and you can already tell you're not going to enjoy this...|
10421|#&7$Agatha##br#
"All right, %n%. By now you should know that, as Falcons, we have to take on all#br#
 manner of assignments, correct? And you're supposed to welcome each and#br#
 every one of them as an opportunity for growth..."#br#
 You're not sure you like the way this conversation is heading. #M320090$Agatha$4$$1$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"And, as your mentor, I am, of course, supposed to supply you with as many#br#
 of these 'opportunities' as possible! Which is why I'm graciously going to allow#br#
 you to take my place on this URGENT assignment I just received from the EERC!" #M320090$Agatha$1$51$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Somehow you get the feeling you're about to be assigned something truly mundane#br#
 and/or despicable, but, unfortunately, you lack the authority to tamper with fate.#char$$826$$0$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"The good old Elysium Environmental Research Council comes to us from time to#br#
 to ask for samples and what-not, and this time, it's no different! Seems they#br#
 need some new specimens from Sporefall Forest. I told them my enthusiastic trainee#br#would be more than willing to assist them with this task." #M320090$Agatha$4$$1$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"Here. You'll need these #&46$tools#. This list should tell you everything they#br#
 need. Don't get stingy! Get your hands dirty if you have to. I want you to feel,#br#
 smell, and LIVE those specimens! Once you've got enough, take 'em to Angel.#br#
 He'll get them safely delivered to the EERC." #M320090$Agatha$821$51$1$0#|
10422|#&7$Angel##br#
"Hey! You're looking bright and chipper today, %n%!#br#
 You got those samples for the EERC, yet?" #M308060$Angel$4$$1$0#|
10423|#&7$%n%##br#
 You hand over the (rather sticky) samples you collected to Angel, glad to be rid of them.#char$$1$$0$0#

#&7$Angel##br#
"Perfect! Just enough, too! Was afraid I might have to send you #br#
 back out for more. Wait here a moment, would ya?"#br#
 Angel rummages through the foul-smelling amalgam#br#
 of rotten forest specimens. #M308060$Angel$821$51$1$0#|
10430|From slime collector to delivery boy, you're really moving up in the world! Said no one ever. At least you'll be rid of these stomach-churning lumps of rotten flora soon.

Angel's already divided up the portions for you, so delivering them to Flavius, Lottie, and Kayla should be easy as taking a baby Dragomon from its mother...|
10431|#&7$Angel##br#
"Here we go. I've divided them up according to their respective recipients#br#
 to make things easier, so all you've gotta do now is play delivery personnel.#br#
 Think you can handle that? The three names are here on this list."#br#
 Angel hands you a slip of paper, now somewhat gooey from his hands. #M308060$Angel$2$$1$0#

#&7$Angel##br#
"There should be a few left even after you handle the deliveries—those you'll wanna#br#
 take back to the nest with you. I'm sure a certain 'expert' within your institution#br#
 would LOVE to have a look at them..."#br#Angel raises an eyebrow in what you can only assume is sarcastic amusement. #M308060$Angel$4$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Unsure what this gesture is supposed to mean, but seeing that Angel isn't going to#br#
 enlighten you, you simply thank the man and head out to make your deliveries.#br#
 Somehow you get the feeling all will be made clear very soon...#char$$822$$0$0#|
10432|#&7$Agatha##br#
"You're not skirtin' duties are you? Aren't you in the middle of an errand#br#
 for Angel? What are you doin' talkin' to me?!" #M320090$Agatha$4$$1$0#|
10433|#&7$%n%##br#
 Your deliveries made and your bag considerably lighter, you head back to#br# 
 see Agatha and let her know the deed is done. Just as you're about to open#br#your mouth, however, she interrupts you with a flick of her hand.#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"Not now! We've got more important things to worry about than a bunch of #br#
 rotten plants. I just received an urgent request from one of our colleagues!#br#
 Like it or not, I'm gonna need your help." #M320090$Agatha$821$$1$0#|
10434|#&7$Flavius##br#
"Hm? And just who're you?" #M314020$Flavius$821$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You quickly introduce yourself before handing over the samples#br#labeled "Flavian" in Angel's blocky handwriting.#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Flavius##br#
"Wowie! I thought it'd take WEEKS to get these new specimens!#br#
 I couldn't wait to get my hands on these slimy sacs of unborn larvae, ohoho!#br#
 Gotta hand it to the Falcons! They get things DONE!" #M314020$Flavius$821$$1$0#|
10435|#&7$Lottie##br#
"Yes? Is there something I can help you with?"  
   #M501030$Lottie$822$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You quickly introduce yourself before handing over the samples#br#labeled "Lottie" in Angel's blocky handwriting.#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Lottie##br#
"Ah, excellent. I'd been waiting for these.#br#
 Truly a blessing that we have the Falcons to turn to for#br#
 things such as this. It would be suicide to venture within#br#
 that ghastly forest on my own! You have my thanks."#M501030$Lottie$1$$1$0#|
10436|#&7$Kayla##br#
"Yeah, whaddya want?#br#
 Yer a hunter, ain'tcha?" #M318040$Kayla$1$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You quickly introduce yourself before handing over the samples#br#labeled "Kayla" in Angel's blocky handwriting.#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Kayla##br#
"Oh! The specimens I requested! Prodigious!#br#
 That crazy forest is like a nightmare! But studying it?#br#
 Tooootally mind-boggling! It's just too bad it's so hard to collect#br#
 samples like this. But, hey, now that I have YOU..." #M318040$Kayla$4$$1$0#|
10440|A group of researchers was attacked by Bobceratops somewhere deep within Sporefall Forest! If you don't get out there quickly, the only thing left to research will be their eviscerated remains!

Hop aboard the nearest gearcopter pronto and keep them safe while Agatha readies a rescue team!|
10441|#&7$Agatha##br#
"While you were taking your sweet time delivering those samples,#br#
 we received a distress call from deep within Sporefall Forest.#br#
 A group of civilians there was attacked by a herd of Bobceratops."#br#
 Agatha's eyes betray her concern despite her aggravated tone of voice. #M320090$Agatha$4$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Immediately taken by surprise, you launch into a flurry of questions—are the#br#
 researchers all right? Aren't Bobceratops normally relatively docile? And#br#perhaps most importantly—who in blazes would live in Sporefall Forest?!#char$$823$$0$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
 "They're not living there, you idiot! They're researchers. But to answer your#br#
 other question—yes. Bobceratops normally ARE docile, which is why this is #br#
more than a little bit strange..." Agatha chews on the inside of her cheek#br#restlessly. #M320090$Agatha$1$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You get the feeling Agatha's not saying something, but at the moment, you#br# have more important things to worry about—like launching an effort to #br#save those researchers!#char$$806$$0$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"At any rate, we've gotta get people in there fast before the whole lot of them#br#
 are gored to Timbuktu and back. I'm just worried that it'll take too much time#br#
 to form a proper rescue party... that's where you come in."
    #M320090$Agatha$821$$1$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"We need somewhere there NOW to stave off the attack as long as possible,#br#
 so I want you to head there first while I work on rallying a team. All you need#br#
 to do is hold them off as long as possible, you hear? And make sure those#br#
 researchers stay put!" #M320090$Agatha$4$$1$0#|
10442|#&7$Agatha##br#
"Seems if it's not one thing, it's another with those numbskulls...#br#
 ...hey! What are you still doing here?!#br# You're gonna get them killed! Get to Sporefall Forest NOW!"
   #M320090$Agatha$4$$1$0#|
10443|#&7$%n%##br#
 You hurry back to Agatha as soon as you arrive in Elysium, relaying the#br#situation in Sporefall Forest (as well as what the researchers told you).#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"You did good, rook. The rescue team should have arrived by now, so there's no more#br#
 need to panic. It really is strange, though—I've never heard of Bobceratops attacking#br#
 like this before. And the fact that they mentioned the mountain behind the village..."#br#Agatha's eyes narrow in concern. #M320090$Agatha$821$$1$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"There's an old laboratory back there. Not in use anymore—place is about as dilapidated#br#
 as they come—but if they've sent people back there... Hmm. I wonder if this could#br#
 have something to do with all this erratic Dragomon behavior."#M320090$Agatha$1$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 As Agatha trails off, you feel a pair of eyes burn into the backside of your skull.#br#
 Twirling around, you come face to face with a girl you've never seen before—#br#and who just so happens to be wearing the most garish hat you've ever seen.#char$$2$$0$0#

#&7$Mystery Girl##br#
"And who is THIS adorable specimen? The famous rookie#br#that's got Bain all discombobulated, I presume?" #M328090$Atelia$4$51$1$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"Oh? Done already? That didn't take you long.#br#
 All the better, though—those samples might give us more insight#br#
 into our current situation than I'd previously thought." #M320090$Agatha$821$51$0$0#

#&7$Mystery Girl##br#
"Did you expect anything less from moi, my dear Agatha? Dissecting#br#
 and analyzing delectable lumps of tissue IS my divertissement, after all.#br#
 That being said, I'm more intrigued by this PRECIOUS little angel right here."#br#
 The girl gives you a carnal once-over that leaves you feeling thoroughly exposed. #M328090$Atelia$4$51$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Not really sure how to respond, you simply let out an awkward#br#"hello," tugging uncomfortably on your shirt collar.|
10444|#&7$%n%##br#
 Once you've secured the perimeter, you quickly dash over to the#br#
 group of researchers to ensure no one's been injured. #M703010$Researcher$4$$1$0#

#&7$Researcher##br#
"You were... you were just in time! I feared we were to become hematic#br#
 decorations on those reptilian fiends' horns for sure! I cannot thank you#br#
 enough, young Falcon. Oh, my poor back... I believe I've strained it..." #M703010$Researcher$503$56$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You ask them what happened—and if they know why the Bobceratops#br#might have attacked them in the first place.#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Researcher##br#
"It all happened so quickly, it's hard to tell. One second we were diagramming breeding #br#
 habits of the local mushroid population, the next? Running for our lives amongst#br#
 the thunderous sound of Bobceratop hooves! It was like a nightmare!" #M703010$Researcher$4$$1$0#

#&7$Researcher##br#
"I can only hypothesize that our repeated and burgeoning efforts to expand the bounds#br#
 of our research aggravated the Bobceratops to the point of extemporaneous violence!#br#
 Further up in the mountains, they, too, must be... oh... oh, my... My head is spinning#br#
 like a short-sighted presupposition..." The poor old man holds his head in his hands. #M703010$Researcher$501$56$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You quickly take his arm and lead him over to a nearby stump, then tell him and#br#
 the others to sit tight and wait for the rescue team from the Falcon's Nest to arrive.#br#You, on the other hand, should hurry back to HQ and let Agatha know what happened!|
10450|You suddenly find yourself escort to Falcon scholar (and most eccentric girl you've ever met) Atelia Myrie as part of an investigation in Sporefall Forest.

Though apprehensive as to how this will all pan out, your curiosity continues to get the best of you, and you hastily make your way deep into the forest to meet her...|
10451|#&7$Agatha##br#
"Ah. Right. I suppose I should introduce you two, huh? Atelia? This is %n%.#br#
 %n%? This is Atelia, executive scholar of the Falcons."#M320090$Agatha$821$$1$0#

#&7$Atelia##br#
"A most sinCERE pleasure to meet you, %n%. Atelia Myrie, at your service!#br# Of course, you may simply call me Atelia. I can already tell there will be no#br#
 need for formalities between us. Ohoho, I can see why Bain is so enamored#br#
 with you. You do reek a sort of beguiling charm..."
   #M328090$Atelia$4$51$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You suddenly remember Angel's use of the word "expert" from earlier, and things#br#
 start clicking in your head. You, too, would probably put mental quotation marks#br#around the word "expert" to describe the girl in front of you.#char$$823$$0$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"You can't be that forward with them, Atelia. They get really skittish around new#br#
 people. Probably some sort of genetic deficiency. Anyway, if you could PLEASE#br#
 fill us in on your findings from those samples, that'd be great. We've got a bit of a#br#situation on our hands..." #M320090$Agatha$4$$1$0#

#&7$Atelia##br#
"Adorably impatient as always, aren't you Agatha? But that's what I love#br#
 about you! Let me see, where did I put that write-up? Where, where, where..."#br#
 Atelia makes a big show of searching all through her pouches and bags.#br#Finally, she procures a yellowed sheet of paper, unfolding it agonizingly slowly. #M328090$Atelia$1$51$1$0#

#&7$Atelia##br#
"Now then, let's see... ah! Yes, I believe my results may just be able to help#br#
 you with this situation of which you speak. My analyses NEVER fail, after all."#br#
 Atelia gives you a licentious glance that makes your spit get stuck in your throat. #M328090$Atelia$821$51$1$0#

#&7$Atelia##br#
"You see, alchemy is a science of balance! Understand the balance of the various#br#
 elements and their spiritual properties, and you understand the very being of the#br#
 land. A deviation in the normal flow of the elements could mean any number of#br#different things—nearly all of them pernicious, let me assure you." #M328090$Atelia$1$$1$0#

#&7$Atelia##br#
"These latest samples you brought me were inundated with a chaotic mix of turmoil#br#
 and turbidity. The very air in that forest seems to be seeped in dysphoria!#br#
 It's no wonder the Dragomon there are becoming increasingly volatile."
   #M328090$Atelia$2$58$1$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"Turmoil and turbidity? Start talking words a girl can understand!#br#
 I don't have a clue what any of that means—or how to go about fixing#br#
 it either. What exactly do you suggest we do about this?" #M320090$Agatha$4$56$0$0#

#&7$Atelia##br#
"I believe I may be of assistance there. If I paid a visit to the laboratory within Sporefall#br#
 Forest, I may be able to narrow in on the exact source of the termagant energy.#br#
 Though, I would need someone to escort me there... It is QUITE dangerous, after all." #M328090$Atelia$4$51$1$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"The laboratory? Hmm..." Agatha's eyes darken for a moment.#br#
 "All right, then. Take %n% with you. Should be able to provide some protection.#br#
 And Atelia, you better not let them slack! They're supposed to be#br#
 training right now." Agatha gives you a little push, and you stumble forward. #M320090$Agatha$821$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You're not sure how you feel about going with Atelia, but you#br#ARE interested in finding out what's going on in the forest#br#(and you're a bit curious about this "ruined laboratory," to boot!).#char$$806$$0$0#

#&7$Atelia##br#
"Oh, how WONderful! I couldn't have chosen a better escort myself!#br#
 %n%, I have a few preparations to make before we go cavorting about in#br#the forest, so meet me there in a bit, would you? I'll be waaaaaiting!" #M328090$Atelia$4$54$1$0#|
10452|#&7$Agatha##br#
"The more I think about it, the more I'm sure this attack wasn't just some random#br#
 incident. Get over to Sporefall and find Atelia. Hopefully you guys can find something..." #M320090$Agatha$4$$1$0#|
10453|#&7$Agatha##br#
"Holy Elysian tributary! You two both look like you've seen a ghost!#br#
 What the heck happened out there?" #M320090$Agatha$4$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Still out of breath, you hurriedly relay your encounter with the giant, #&46$unknown##br##&46$Dragomon#, explaining that it ran away before you were able to finish it off.#char$$4$$0$0#
  

#&7$Agatha##br#
"An unknown Dragomon? You mean, Atelia didn't even know what it was?#br#
 Here I thought she knew every Dragomon known to man!"#br#Agatha crosses her arms in front of her chest, eyes darkening. #M320090$Agatha$1$$1$0#

#&7$Atelia##br#
"It was, indeed, a species I'm unfamiliar with. Or, perhaps, an aberration of sorts."#br#
 You and Agatha turn around as Atelia approaches from the direction of the gearcopter. #M328090$Atelia$351$$1$0#

#&7$Atelia##br#
"Though similar in shape and size to the Crocargot genus, it boasted features I've not#br#
 seen on any other Dragomon, and its coloring was peculiar. What was most alarming,#br#
 however, was the enormous energy radiating from it. It displayed the same erratic#br#
 elemental patterns as what I discovered in those samples from earlier."#M328090$Atelia$4$$1$0#

#&7$Atelia##br#
"If I had to take a guess, I'd say it's this very energy that's causing the Bobceratops#br#
 and other Dragomon to behave so strangely, and we might have just found the source." #M328090$Atelia$2$$1$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"But where did this thing COME from? You said you'd never seen a Crocargot with#br#
 those kinds of features before. You don't think... it's somehow a result of #&46$THAT#, do#br#
 you?" Agatha glances around nervously, her voice hissing between her teeth. #M320090$Agatha$4$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You've never seen Agatha this on edge before. "That?" What could she mean#br#
 by "that?" Your mind is plagued with a torrent of questions.#char$$806$$0$0#

#&7$Atelia##br#
"Hm? What was that? I don't think I heard you very well, dear.#br#
 At any rate, our main concern now should be locating this chimera before#br#
 it can infect any other areas with its energy."#br#
 Atelia raises her voice boisterously, quickly changing the subject. #M328090$Atelia$821$51$1$0#|
10454|Investigate the suspicious object nearby|
10455|Complete your investigation of the ruined laboratory|
10461|"%n%, I ask that you allow me to be frank.#br#
 Sporefall Forest was once a beautiful land of flourishing, natural greenery.#br#
 Cool, clean water... sweet, fresh air... that is, until it became the central hub of this#br#continent's Dragocite research..." #10217$821$1$0#

"A group of highly-regarded scientists and researchers banded together to uncover the#br#
 secret behind Dragocite, and—were it fortuitous—unlock the latent energy stored within.#br#
 All eyes were on this forest. All hearts longed for success. The key, as it were, to harvesting#br#the full power of the legendary Dragocite." #10217$822$1$0#

"As you might be able to guess, however, the experiment proved a failure.#br#
 Yes, the scientists were ultimately able to tap into the swirling vortex of the Dragocite's#br#
 core, but upon doing so, they released all that uncontrollable, turbid energy into the#br#wild. It destroyed this forest. It turned it into what you see here, today." #10217$826$1$0#

"I... I was one of those researchers. I am part of the reason the forest is what it is today.#br# I betrayed my own colleagues—my own friends—in order to survive the blast.#br#
 It still haunts me to this day... not only what I did to this forest, but my unfathomable#br#
 selfishness. That is why I seek a way to return this forest to its former beauty."#10217$827$1$0#
  

At this, Patrick grows quiet, seemingly lost in thought.#br#
Unsure of what to do, you can do little but stand and wait.#char$4$0$0#

"...take these reports. They comprise data compiled from those years of research.#br#
 These mushrooms are proof that part of this forest yet lives uncontaminated. With this#br#
 data, there might just be something we can do. Please take it to Agatha for me?#br# If there's anyone who could successfully spearhead these efforts, it's her." #10217$821$1$0#|
10462|"It will not be an easy process, nor a speedy one, but I believe with the proper#br#
 research, there is still hope for this forest. We can never give up so long as that#br#
 chance remains." #10217$821$1$0#|
10463|You quickly head back to the Falcon's Nest and give Agatha the reports.

 Hm? And just what is all this? Some kind of files...?"

10464|Patrick's compiled his old research for easy reference

"All right, then, what do YOU propose we do, Atelia?" #M320090$Agatha$4$$1$0#

#&7$Atelia##br#
"As it so happens, I have an idea as to where the beast might have gone.#br#

   #M328090$Atelia$4$$1$0#

#&7$Atelia##br#
"I should be able to use the molecular vibrations left in the air to ascertain a#br#
 rough location of our mutant friend. Alchemy is, after all, all about balance,#br#
 and that whirling mass of chaos has created enough imbalances that it might#br#
 as well have a giant sign on its back labeled 'here I am!'" #M328090$Atelia$821$51$1$0#

#&7$Atelia##br#
"I will need to visit Primeval Marsh, of course. The closer I am to the source of the#br#

 some time, so I will need someone there to protect me until it's complete..."#M328090$Atelia$4$$1$0#  

#&7$Agatha##br#
"Just take %n%! Problem solved!"#br#
 Agatha shakes your shoulder.#br#
 You're starting to feel like some kind of commodity. #M320090$Agatha$4$51$1$0#

#&7$Atelia##br#
"Oh, how perfect! I was just thinking along those same lines myself.#br#
 %n%, dear, meet me atop the western mountain in Primeval Marsh, would you?#br#
 I have to run along and prepare the necessary materials, but I'll be there shortly!"#br#
 With a brisk click of her heels, she turns around and walks off, laughing to herself. #M328090$Atelia$4$51$1$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"I've got a baaad feeling about this, %n%.#br#
 We need to put a stop to this thing before it#br#
 Isn't that right, %n%?" #M320090$Agatha$821$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Once Atelia is out of earshot, you take your chances and ask Agatha#br#
 what she'd meant by "#&46$that#" in your prior conversation.#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"You really wanna know? I guess I don't blame you.#br#
 I'll... join you two, then. For the ritual, I mean.#br#
 I'm sure a lot more will be made clear once we're there..."#br#
 The more she talks about it, the worse you imagine whatever "that" is must be... #M320090$Agatha$4$$1$0#|
10472|#&7$Agatha##br#
"I'll explain more once we get to Primeval Marsh.#br# It'll be... easier to show you than tell you.#br#
 Anyway, let me know when you're ready." #M320090$Agatha$4$$1$0# |
10473|#&7$%n%##br#
 You return to Elysium to find Agatha waiting#br#
 for you back in the Falcon's Nest.#char$$1$$0$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"Took you long enough. How did the ritual go?#br#
 Any good news?"#br#
 Despite Agatha's flippant tone, you can tell she's concerned. #M320090$Agatha$4$$1$0#

#&7$Atelia##br#
"Quite! I was able to narrow down the location of our Crocargot beastie to the#br#
 northwestern corner of Primeval Marsh. A resounding success, if I do say#br#
 so myself, though I'll admit I'm... a bit tired, now. It takes a considerable amount#br#
 of concentration to analyze such a vast amount of high-energy molecular patterns."#M328090$Atelia$2$58$1$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"You mean it's in there now? Then what are we doing here instead of#br#
 being in the marsh heading it off?! Let's get a team together! C'mon!"#br#
 Agatha jerks forward and grabs Atelia's arm. #M320090$Agatha$825$$0$0#

#&7$Atelia##br#
"There's no real reason to go rushing off heedlessly, my dear Agatha.#br#
 The energy patterns appear to be quite stable as they are—if anything, they#br#
 are even settling down! I believe this is what they commonly refer to as 'nap#br# time?' In other words, your snail of a pet won't be running off any time soon."
     #M328090$Atelia$4$$1$0#

#&7$Atelia##br#
"Speaking of nap time, I would very much benefit from such a delightful moment#br#
 of respite myself. I'm feeling a bit faint. At any rate, I feel this is something that#br#
 should be discussed with Van. We don't know the full extent of this creature's strength,#br#after all." #M328090$Atelia$826$56$1$0#

#&7$Atelia##br#
"We must also take into account the wide scope of the area in question.#br#
 While I was able to narrow down the Crocargot's location to a designated#br#
 perimeter within the marsh, that area is far too large to just go traipsing about#br#
 in search of it." Atelia suddenly pulls out a pad of paper and pencil, scribbling furiously. #M328090$Atelia$2$56$1$0#

#&7$Atelia##br#
"Here... I shall map out the results of my analysis." Atelia bites down on her tongue,#br#
 one eye narrowed as she scrawls out what appears to be a strange amalgam of diagrams#br#
 and numbers. "This is a map of the atmospheric elemental density distribution within#br#
 Primeval Marsh. It reveals the exact location of our giant, primordial lugabug."
     #M328090$Atelia$1$51$1$0#

#&7$Atelia##br#
"Unfortunately, it must first be deciphered, as I'm fairly certain you kind people will#br#
 not be able to make heads or tails of it. Just ask someone from the Alchemic Order!#br#
 Atelia rips off the sheet of paper—now practically black from pencil marks—and#br#
 hands it to you. "Now, then... I really must lie down for a moment. Need to... rest my eyes..."
   #M328090$Atelia$4$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You glance down at the map you've been given as Atelia stumbles off for her cat-nap.#br#
 True to her word, the map looks like ancient Greek to you! Or maybe hieroglyphics? Whatever#br#it is, you and your never-took-a-math-class-past-algebra self will need some help!#char$$826$$0$0#|
10474|#&7$Agatha##br#
"Take a good look around you, %n%. Notice anything?#br#
 Beautiful, isn't it? Lush trees. Green grasses. Abundant life.#br#
 Sporefall Forest used to look like this, too. That is... before #&46$THAT# happened..." #M320090$Agatha$821$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Sporefall Forest was once... like THIS?! You can scarcely believe your ears!#br#
 There was no way that slough of toxic squalor could ever have been a place of beauty.#char$$823$$0$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"Remember that laboratory you went to? Well, what was left of it, anyway?#br#
 It was once a full-fledged facility with gizmos I can't even begin to name.#br#
 They used to perform all kinds of crazy experiments on Dragocite there."#M320090$Agatha$4$$1$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"A bunch of the smartest up-and-coming scientists were trying to tap into the#br#
 innate energy imbued within Dragocite—to use it as a power source, you know?#br#
 The project had a lot of supporters. After all, Dragocite's full potential had never#br#been utilized before. Succeed and the possibilities were endless." #M320090$Agatha$4$$1$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"But... the experiment failed. Those scientists didn't understand the full extend of what#br#
 they were dealing with, and upon releasing that power, it destroyed everything.#br#
 Countless lives were lost, and Sporefall Forest turned into what you see today."
   #M320090$Agatha$1$$1$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"The power of Dragocite is both awe-inspiring and terrifying. Without a way to#br#
 control it, it could destroy cities, worlds, even. Yet, as humans, we're drawn to that power.#br#
 Seduced by it. And THAT... that is the most terrifying part of all."#M320090$Agatha$821$$1$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"...anyway, I'm guessing Atelia's almost ready. You should head over to the#br#
 western mountain so she can begin the ritual. I-... wanna spend a little more time#br# here. Once you two are done with everything, meet me back in Elysium."
   #M320090$Agatha$4$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 A Dragocite laboratory? You admit, that's not quite what you'd been expecting to hear.#br#
 If all this really DOES have something to do with the mutant Dragomon you're#br#pursuing, things could get really ugly—really fast. #&46$Better find Atelia quick!# And#br#pray to the Dragomon god that everything goes smoothly...#char$$822$$0$0#|
10475|#&7$Atelia##br#
"Ah! There you are, %n%! I've only been waiting#br#
 up here a couple of hours. No bother!" #M328090$Atelia$4$51$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You jog over to where Atelia is readying the ritual, stopping for a moment#br#
 to catch your breath before mentioning your run-in with Agatha earlier.#br#
 As a passing thought, you add that something seemed a little... off about Agatha, as well.

#&7$Atelia##br#
"With Agatha? Bah. Something's always off about that one! You really shouldn't pay#br#
 it too much mind. At any rate, we have more important things to focus on—like#br#
 finding our musical friend, Mr. Crocagot!" #M328090$Atelia$4$51$1$0#

#&7$Atelia##br#
"We were already able to ascertain that the beast ENTERED the marsh, yes?#br#
 But obviously the Primeval Marsh is a decently-sized locale, so a more narrow#br#
 pinpointing of the elusive creature shall be necessary." #M328090$Atelia$1$$1$0#

#&7$Atelia##br#
"How we will do that is simple! You see, this mutant creature radiates an aura of chaotic, turbid#br#
 energy patterns. These patterns, by nature, oppose the molecular wavelengths commonly#br#
 associated with alchemy. The collision of these two energy waves creates thousands of minute#br#
 bursts of antipodal energy. By locking onto these, I can more precisely lock on to the beast's location." #M328090$Atelia$821$$1$0#

#&7$Atelia##br#
"The one thing I'm worried about, however, is whether or not other Dragomon in the region#br#
 will be drawn to the sudden outflux of charged molecules. That is why I need someone#br#
 to #&46$protect me until the ritual is complete#—something you should be able to handle#br#
 with ease, no? That's what I thought! Let me know when you're ready to begin." #M328090$Atelia$821$$1$0#|
10476|I'm all set!. Let's get this show on the road.|
10477|Protect Atelia|
10478|Head towards the western mountain and meet up with Atelia.|
10479|Head to Primeval Marsh|
10480|The deciphered map has revealed the location of the Primordial Crocargot! It's now practically within your grasp! Despite being urged to wait for Van Pelt's return, Agatha insists the two of you head out immediately to hunt the beast down, but before you can so much as step towards the nearest gearcopter, Bain stops you in your tracks, and you find yourself once more in the middle of a dangerous game.

Feeling more and more like a prized centerfold coveted by two alphas, you head out to the marsh for your most jeopardous hunt yet...|
10481|#&7$Agatha##br#
"Knowing that thing is out there just beyond our reach is driving me CRAZY!#br#
 WHERE is Pelt? It's JUST like him to run off when we need him most.#br#
 That's it! I've had enough!" Agatha abruptly turns towards you and Delphia,#br# knuckles white around the map.
    #M320090$Agatha$825$55$1$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"We know where it is, so why aren't we hunting it down?#br#
 We can't just sit here and let that thing, I don't know, move somewhere#br#
 else! Contaminate another area! We could lose our window!#br#C'mon, %n%—you and I are gonna take that thing out ourselves." #M320090$Agatha$4$51$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Quite taken aback by this proposal, you turn helplessly to Delphia.#br#
 While it's true you wanna clobber this Crocargot, too, this seems in direct#br#
 opposition to what the Falcons normally stand for. And what about the imminent#br#danger Atelia'd mentioned? This thing is no pushover!#char$$821$$0$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"If Pelt insists on being M.I.A. constantly, what other choice do we have?#br#
 Let that thing run off? Let it attack the city? How would YOU like to be#br#
 the one people blame when all of Elysium is contaminated by that thing?"#br#
 Agatha emphasizes each of her statements with a finger jab at your chest. #M320090$Agatha$4$$1$0#

#&7$Bain##br#
"Insubordination, now? Tsk tsk."#br#
 You and Agatha whip your heads to the left, practically in-sync,#br#to see Bain leaning up against the nearby wall. #M310090$Bain$1$$1$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"Oh, goody! My most FAVorite person in the world!#br#
 Stop creeping around like that! You're enough of a creeper#br#
 as it is. No need to emphasize it more."#M320090$Agatha$823$55$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Bain doesn't respond, cool and collected as always (or perhaps just 100% done).#br#
 When you bring a shy hand up to greet him, his eyes flick towards you#br#momentarily, and his gaze softens.#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Bain##br#
"What seems to be the problem?"#br#
 The question appears to be directed at you, but you're not sure how to#br#
 respond. Bain walks to your side before tilting his head towards Agatha. #M310090$Bain$821$$1$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"There's no problem! %n% and I were just on our way to hunt down a#br#
 newly-discovered Dragomon in the marsh. Certainly nothing to concern#br#
 YOUR perfectly-coiffed hair with! So why don't you just beat it before I#br# beat YOU?" Agatha steps forward between you and Bain, eyes ablaze.
    #M320090$Agatha$4$55$0$0#

#&7$Bain##br#
"A newly-discovered Dragomon?" Bain's hand goes instinctively to the grip of his sword.#br#
 "What's it worth?" He remains oblivious to Agatha's biting remarks.#br#
  
    #M310090$Bain$4$$1$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"That's all that matters to you, isn't it? Whatever. It's certainly stronger#br# than anything YOU'VE ever taken down before." Agatha brushes imaginary#br#
 dust from her shoulder-piece, nose upturned.
    #M320090$Agatha$4$55$0$0#

#&7$Bain##br#
Bain is silent for a moment. Then, his lips curl into an impish smile.#br#
 "Shall we continue our little game from before?"
  
    #M310090$Bain$821$$1$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"You still think you can win, don't you? HA! Wonderful.#br# I was thinking along those same lines myself! Whoever#br#
 nabs that thing first gets the loser at their beck and call#br#
 for an entire day. I hope you're partial to lace, pretty boy." #M320090$Agatha$825$55$0$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"Our target's here—in the marsh. Got it memorized?#br# You better have, because I'm not showing you twice."#br#
 Agatha shoves the map in Bain's face before just as abruptly#br#
yanking it back. "I WON'T lose this time, Blitzhardt."   
    #M320090$Agatha$4$55$0$0#

#&7$Bain##br#
"Heh. We'll see. %n%, you come, too. I'd love to see you in action again."#br#
 Bain's tone is sharp, but you catch the inklings of a smile in the look he sends your way.
  
   #M310090$Bain$821$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You nod your head—not wanting to let Bain down, of all people—but remain#br#
 apprehensive. Something about this operation just doesn't sit right with you...#char$$822$$0$0#|
10482|#&7$Agatha##br#
"You just wait, Bain. You just WAIT!"#br#
 Agatha practically hisses between her teeth. #M320090$Agatha$825$55$1$0#|
10483|#&7$Agatha##br#
"Next time, Bain! Next time! That thing is still out there—and#br#
 I'm still gonna be the one to bring it down!" #M320090$Agatha$825$55$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You return to the Falcon's Nest to find Agatha back to her normal,#br#
 agitated self. She's stomping restlessly back and forth across the nest,#br#but stops upon your approach.#char$$806$$0$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"%n%! My favorite squirt! How's life treatin' ya?#br#
 You turn to find Van Pelt walking towards you from across the nest. He#br#
 gives you a winning smile that you return until he slaps your back... hard. #M330090$Van Pelt$4$51$1$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"PELT! Do you have ANY idea how long I've been waiting for you?!#br#
 Where were you this time? Sleeping? Goofing off? Messing around with#br#
 some little chickadee two towns over?" Agatha instinctively unsheathes#br#
 her swords, making a beeline towards Pelt. #M320090$Agatha$4$55$0$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"Holy highroller, Agatha! What's got you so... so... VIOLENT?!"#br#
 Pelt takes a nervous step backwards, face paling.#br#
He leans in towards you with a fierce whisper.#br#"What's got the firecracker about ready to explode?"
   #M330090$Van Pelt$826$54$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You quickly relay everything that's happened with the newly-discovered Dragomon#br#
 in Sporefall Forest, as well as your encounter with the beast in Primeval Marsh.#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"...while Daddy's away, the Dragomon play, it seems. Yikes..."#br#
 Van Pelt falls silent, wrinkles forming across his brow.
   #M330090$Van Pelt$4$$1$0#|
10484|#&7$%n%##br#
 Upon landing in Primeval Marsh, you jump down from your gearcopter and#br#
 glance around in search of your companions. You spot Bain leaning against #br#one of the nearby trees and quickly jog over.#char$$2$$0$0#

#&7$Bain##br#
"Change of plans, %n%. Agatha already took off. It's just the two of us."#br#
 Bain pushes himself away from the tree, squinting in your direction as you approach.  
   #M310091$Bain$1$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Somehow, this doesn't surprise you. The one thing you've come to realize about#br#
 Agatha is that she hates to lose—AND she hates Bain. These two facts together spelled#br#disaster from the very beginning.#char$$826$$0$0#

#&7$Bain##br#
"This has turned into a rescue mission. We can't proceed until we find her."#br# Bain is visibly unhappy with this turn of events. He restlessly shuffles his feet.
   #M310091$Bain$4$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You try to convince Bain that Agatha can take care of herself—you've seen enough of#br#
 her in action to be sure of that. Bain just chews on the inside of his cheek, brows furrowed.#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Bain##br#
"Just because she would abandon us doesn't mean we should abandon her.#br#
 Head north and search the area. I'll search around here.#br# And %n%!" Bain takes your arm, looking you straight in the eye.#br#
 "If you run into our target, DON'T be reckless. Wait for backup. Understood?"    
   #M310091$Bain$1$$1$0#|
10485|#&7$%n%##br#
 Serratogator corpses lie strewn about the perimeter, and the air reeks of#br#
 blood and decay. Your eyes narrow in concern as you walk towards Agatha.#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"So many at once..."#br#
 Agatha appears to be mumbling to herself as she surveys the carnage.#br#
 She hasn't noticed your approach. #M320091$Agatha$1$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Something feels off. VERY off. But you can't quite put your finger on it.#br#
 Worried about Agatha (but worried about your own safety as well), you stop#br#a few steps away and call her name.#char$$821$$0$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"What? Oh, it's you, %n%. I-..." Her eyes flash from you to the Serratogator corpses.#br#
 "It's not what it looks like. That... that THING. That Dragomon did this! In only a matter#br#of seconds, too..."#M320091$Agatha$1$$1$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"It was... it was huge. And savage, it-...!! It was much bigger than I'd#br#
 expected from your description. And the way it attacked! Like a... like a monster..."#br#
 You've never seen Agatha like this before. It's almost... unnerving.
   #M320091$Agatha$4$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Not sure how to respond, you simply bring a hand up to Agatha's shoulder.#br#
 To your continued surprise, she doesn't push you away.#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Bain##br#
"It ran off, did it?"#br#
 You hear footsteps from the way you came, and#br#glance back to see Bain emerge from the brush. #M310091$Bain$1$$0$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"Yeah, it DID! I wasn't able to stop it. And so what?#br# Blighted thing was the size of a three-story building.#br#
 Agatha instantly jerks away from you, returning to her normal,#br#firecracker self.
   #M320091$Agatha$4$55$1$0#

#&7$Bain##br#
"Which way?"#br#
 Bain's eyes narrow as he looks off towards the nearby trees.#br#
 He hasn't seemed to have noticed the Serratogator corpses. #M310091$Bain$821$$0$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"Deeper into the marsh! I don't know! I'm not a human compass!"#br#
 Each word from Bain's mouth seems to infuriate Agatha all the more. #M320091$Agatha$825$55$1$0#

#&7$Bain##br#
"...we should get back to the nest and let Van and the others know.#br# We'll need an entire hunting party to take this thing down."#br#
 Bain's own tone never falters. Without another word, he turns#br#
 back towards the direction of the gearcopter and takes off.
   #M310091$Bain$822$$0$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"I was just gonna suGGEST that, pretty boy! Don't you go getting all#br#
 high-and-mighty on me! Ugh! Come on, %n%—let's go. Chop chop!"#br#
 Agatha stomps off after Bain, leaving you no choice but to follow. #M320091$Agatha$4$$1$0#|
10486|Head to Primeval Marsh|
10487|Search for Agatha in the northern part of Primeval Marsh.|
10490|Agatha has been ordered to stay at the Falcon's Nest. As such, the mission of tracking down <Primordial Crocargot> Bowzar has fallen to Bain. Bain, it seems, is keen on working with you, but needs to ascertain your skill level first.

Hop in the nearest gearcopter and make your way to the marsh to see just what he has in mind!|
10491|#&7$Agatha##br#
"Pelt! If we don't get out there ASAP and deal with this thing, ALL our necks#br#
 will be on the line—and yours'll be first in the noose."#br#
 Agatha's hands tighten around her sword grips as she stands there fuming. #M320090$Agatha$821$$1$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"Increased aggression in the local Dragomon population...#br#
 an attack on the researchers in Sporefall Forest...#br#
 a mutant species of Dragomon roaming the marsh..."#br#
 Van Pelt rubs his chin in thought, brows furrowed. #M330090$Van Pelt$1$$0$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"What is there to THINK about?!"#br#
 Agatha takes a few menacing steps forward,#br#
 flames practically visible above her head. #M320090$Agatha$825$55$1$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"Whoa, whoa, whoa, no need to go all warrior princess on me! There's just, well, a lot of#br# things to take into consideration! We're obviously going to need a plan of attack, a solid#br#
 team, AND a backup strategy if we have any hopes of handling this thing without#br#
 getting ourselves killed." Pelt remains surprisingly calm despite Agatha's pressure.
   #M330090$Van Pelt$4$51$0$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"Yeah, and how long will THAT take? By the time we get mom 'n pop's ragtag#br#
 band together, that thing could be MILES away! Then what do we do? Huh?"#br#
 Agatha flings her arm out, nearly sending her sword flying. #M320090$Agatha$821$55$1$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"Never fear, my fiery purple-haired demoness! I've already thought of a way to avoid#br#
 this unfortunate fate. I'll have Bain track down the Primordial Croca-... Croca... mamie..#br#
 Oh, blast it all! I'm calling it #&46$Bowzar# from now on, OK? Bain will track down Bowzar#br#
 and monitor any possible migratory efforts. That make you happy?"
   #M330090$Van Pelt$821$$0$0#

#&7$Bain##br#
"On it."#br#
 Bain tips his head in acknowledgement. #M310090$Bain$822$$1$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"Bain? Why Bain? I'd be just as—if not MORE—efficient than him!"#br#
 Agatha doesn't even look at the man in question, her eyes, instead,#br#
 burning holes in the side of Pelt's skull. #M320090$Agatha$4$$1$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"I'd actually like you to... to stand by here in the nest for the time being, Agatha."#br#
 Pelt's voice lowers. There's something about his expression that makes a stone#br#
 form in your gut. #M330090$Van Pelt$4$51$0$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"S-... stand by? Stand BY?! What is THAT supposed to mean?!"#br#
 Agatha shakes as though she's about to explode. #M320090$Agatha$825$55$1$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"Surely an experienced hunter like you knows what 'stand by'#br#
 means, yeah? You sit tight here in HQ and await further orders!"#br#
 A tiny smirk forms on Van Pelt's face. #M330090$Van Pelt$821$$0$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"I KNOW what 'STAND BY' means, Pelt! What I WANT to know is WHY?#br#
  Why keep me in here when I could be out there taking this thing down?!"#br#
 Agatha stomps towards Van Pelt, right up in his face as she quivers with rage.
   #M320090$Agatha$825$$1$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
In a surprising turn of events, Pelt returns the glare with his own look of hardened#br# determination. "Because you're like an emotional time bomb, Agatha, and I'm not about#br#
 to get you or anyone else killed due to your impetuosity. Now, you're to STAND BY#br#
 in the nest and await further orders... got it?" Pelt's voice is scarily icy.
    #M330090$Van Pelt$826$$0$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
Agatha's eyes widen in shock, and she takes a shaky step backwards.#br#
 Finally, she whips her head around and noisily stomps away.

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"All right, then! It's settled! Bain will track down Bowzar and keep that varmint deadlocked.#br# In the meantime, I'll get a hold of Nash and Garth. We'll need as much firepower#br#
 as we can get with this one. Once I get a tentative team formed, I'll rally everyone#br#
 together so we can flesh out a plan of attack." Pelt claps his hands before wandering off.  
   #M330090$Van Pelt$4$51$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You wait until Van Pelt is out of earshot before glancing back at Agatha, still#br#
 quiet and motionless a few feet away. You find yourself at a bit of a loss.#char$$2$$0$0#

#&7$Bain##br#
Just as you're about to take a step towards her, Bain's hand comes down on your shoulder.#br#
 "May I, Agatha?" He glances towards the back of her head.
 
   #M310090$Bain$821$$1$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"Yeah, yeah, sure... whatever..." #M320090$Agatha$4$$1$0#

#&7$Bain##br#
Bain nods in acknowledgement, then begins to lead you out of the nest.#br#
 "%n%, I'd like to work with you during this hunting operation, but I first#br#
 need to ascertain your skill level. I wouldn't want to put you in harm's way."#br#
 Your eyes widen in surprise, and you quickly spin around to face him.
   #M310090$Bain$1$$1$0#

#&7$Bain##br#
"The Marsh Crocoturtles in Primeval Marsh are currently in a state of semi-dormancy#br#
 as they settle down for their hibernation. Their decreased aggression would make#br#
 them adequate opponents. Meet me in the marsh once you're ready."#br#
 Bain gives your shoulder a crisp pat before turning on his heels and walking away. #M310090$Bain$821$$1$0#|
10492|#&7$Agatha##br#
"This is absolute ludicrousy!
 So help me, Pelt...!!"#br#
 Agatha growls and turns away. #M320090$Agatha$825$55$1$0#|
10493|#&7$Agatha##br#
"Oh. You're back. Hi."#br#
 Agatha seems overcome with excitement upon your return. #M320090$Agatha$4$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You begin to tell her about your trip to the marsh, but she waves you off#br#before you can get more than a few words out.#char$$1$$0$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"Yeah, yeah, whatever. I'm sure you've got the great Bain's approval, like always!#br#
 Even I could have told you you'd have no trouble against a few measly Crocoturtles!"#br#
 Agatha grumbles under her breath, clearly not impressed. #M320090$Agatha$821$$1$0#|
10494|#&7$Bain##br#
"You made good work of those Crocoturtles..." Bain calmly examines the corpses of the#br#
 slain reptiles before returning his gaze to you. "But you still have work to do."#br#
He takes a step in your direction, grabbing your wrist and turning your arm over.#br#
 You're surprised by a long scratch you hadn't even realized you'd incurred.
   #M310090$Bain$1$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You pull your arm back with a slightly overzealous jerk, assuring him it's#br#nothing—nothing at all! You didn't even feel it! The last thing you want is#br#for Bain to decide you're too green to take with him on the hunt.#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Bain##br#
"...all right. So long as you believe you're ready, then, you have my approval."#br#
 Bain's features soften into a smile—one you haven't seen in a while!—that practically#br#
makes your heart soar. "I need to stay here and begin tracking down Bowzar.#br#
 You head back to HQ. I'll report anything I find, so just sit tight."   #M310090$Bain$821$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Body relaxing upon receiving Bain's acceptance, you shoot him a cheeky little salute,#br#
 wish him luck, and then head back towards the gearcopter to return to Elysium.#char$$822$$0$0#|

First, she'll need you to procure some supplies.|
10501|#&7$%n%##br#
 You're unsure what else to say. Agatha's despondency makes you feel guilty#br#
 about bringing up anything work-related, but you've never really talked to#br#her about anything else.#char$$826$$0$0#

#&7$Atelia##br#
"Oh, %n%! Agathaaaa! There you are, dears!#br#
 Could the two of you lend me a hand with something?"#br#
 Your compelling conversation with Agatha is interrupted by a familiar#br# voice, and you turn your head to spy Atelia making her way towards you. #M328090$Atelia$4$$1$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"Oh... hi, Atelia. Don't know how much help I'll be. Can't#br#
 leave the nest on account of stupid Pelt grounding me."#br#
 Agatha lets out an over-exaggerated sigh of despair. #M320090$Agatha$826$56$0$0#

#&7$Atelia##br#
"Grounded? How droll! That must be terribly boring for you."#br#
 Atelia's face falls... for a moment. All of a sudden, her smile returns, and she#br#
shoots Agatha a mischievous grin. "Then how about we have %n% take care#br# of this piddly-widdly work while you, Delphia, and I have a girl's night in, hm?"
   #M328090$Atelia$4$51$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 As much as you hate being the saddler of everything that could possibly be saddled#br#
 around here, you admit that it'd be good for Agatha to be around friends. You ask#br#Atelia what exactly this "piddly-widdly work" entails.#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Atelia##br#
"It's quite fascinating, actually. You see, deep within the bowels of Sporefall Forest,#br#
 hunters have reported seeing a field of flowers. In any other region, this wouldn't raise#br# any eyebrows, but in Sporefall Forest, this is cause for scientific stupefaction.#br#
 We believe there might be something innately exceptional about these blooms." #M328090$Atelia$821$$1$0#

#&7$Atelia##br#
"Premature observations have cautiously concluded that surrounding wildlife, too, has been#br#
 affected by the aura of these flowers—some of them even becoming immune to the#br#
 surrounding mutation! Can you imagine the progress we could make if we only had samples#br#
 of these flowers to test?" Atelia's voice practically rattles the ramparts in her excitement. #M328090$Atelia$4$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You ask Atelia if, in fact, your task will be to go collect these flowers in question.#char$$821$$0$0#

#&7$Atelia##br#
"Always the smart cookie-cutter, aren't we, %n%? Actually, though, there is a#br#
 bit of, hrm, SHOPPING I'd like you to do for me first while I finish up my preliminary#br#
 reading. Important materials, you know? It's a very small list, trust me!"#br#
 Atelia pulls a list out of her pocket that unrolls all the way to the ground. #M328090$Atelia$2$51$1$0#

#&7$Atelia##br#
"If you would, then, %n%? Don't worry about the money—just tell them to charge#br#
 everything to the Falcon account! Easy as chocolate, bumbleberry crumb cake!"#br#
 Atelia flashes you a winning smile. #M328090$Atelia$821$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You're not sure if the Falcons truly have money for all these items—what was it Delphia'd#br#
 said about the treasury thanks to Van Pelt?—but if Atelia says it's all right, then#br#
 it must be all right! Guess it's time to play delivery personnel again.#char$$806$$0$0#|
10502|#&7$Agatha##br#
"Atelia's still buried away in her books. Have you bought everything yet?#br#
 Well, hurry up! She hasn't got all day, you know. Or maybe she does... who knows."#br#
 Agatha's shoulders droop. These sudden changes in personality are throwing you for a loop! #M320090$Agatha$1$$1$0#|
10503|#&7$Agatha##br#
"Oh, you're back! That was quick. Atelia! %n%'s back already.#br#
  What'd I tell ya? Pretty speedy for a little tyke." Agatha shouts#br#
 over at Atelia, who's currently up to her ears in books in the corner. #M320090$Agatha$4$$1$0#

#&7$Atelia##br#
"Oh, perfect! You're just a doll! And everything will be#br# delivered here, right? Wonderful. Just wonderful!"#br#
 She doesn't even glance up from the book in her hands.
   #M328090$Atelia$1$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Thinking back to the various items requested, you can't help but be just a#br#LITTLE bit curious. You chance a prying question into the items' purpose.#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Atelia##br#
"Oh, you're probably wondering about that meat, hm? No worries!#br#
 Just a little something to keep in the lab as a, oh, you know—emergency#br#
 food source. That type of thing! No big deal, really."#br#Atelia flippantly waves you off. #M328090$Atelia$4$51$1$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"A-... Atelia! You weren't supposed to—!!"#br#
 Agatha whirls around, eyes as round as saucers.#M320090$Agatha$4$$0$0#
  

#&7$Atelia##br#
"Ah-! Did I say emergency food source? I surely meant, erm, an emergency SNACK#br#
 source! You know. In case anyone gets the munchies and wants a big chunk of raw#br#
 meat to gnaw on. Some of these experiments do get rather long, you know."#br#
 Atelia chuckles goodnaturedly before returning to her book with a contented hum. #M328090$Atelia$2$58$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Agatha throws her arms up with an exasperated sigh.#br#
 You simply stand there, more confused than ever.#char$$826$$0$0#|
10504|#&7$Olaf##br#
"What's this? You look far too normal to be needing anything from me!"#br# The jolly old bundle in front of you strokes his chin in thought as he gives#br#
 you a thorough once over. You find yourself suddenly very self-conscious.
  
   #M402020$Olaf$821$51$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Taking out Atelia's list, you quickly explain the situation.#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Olaf##br#
"So you're that crazy alchemist's gofer, are you? Ahahaaa... should have known.#br#
 No, no, pay me no mind! It's just that, well... alchemists are a bit of a—how do I put it?#br# A strange lot, yes. Keeps the vending business interesting, I suppose."#br#
 Olaf shrugs apologetically, then grabs the list and begins perusing its (long) contents.
   #M402020$Olaf$2$$1$0#

#&7$Olaf##br#
"Let's see what we've got here... two bags of geothermal conduction powder, a can of#br#
 emerald extract, five hundred grams of crushed fusion grains, five teaspoons of#br#
 distillated crystal fruit essence..." As Olaf reads the never-ending list aloud, his brows#br#
 furrow until they've practically sunk into his eyeballs. #M402020$Olaf$2$53$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You take an instinctive step back as Olaf's whole body begins to tremble.#br#
 Something gives you the feeling that these materials aren't the easiest things#br#in the world to find...#char$$4$$0$0# 

#&7$Olaf##br#
"Quite the... extensive list you've brought me. These things aren't gonna be cheap..."#br# You quickly assure him that everything can be charged to the Falcon account.#br#
 "Is that so? Well! That changes everything, ohoho! Yes, yes, I'd be glad to get you these#br# items—be aware of the hefty finder's fee, yes?—you can count on old Olaf!"  
    
   #M402020$Olaf$821$51$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Satisfied that Olaf will take care of the rest, you bid him farewell.#br#You really hope these purchases won't get you kicked out of the Falcons...#char$$4$$0$0#|
10505|#&7$Calixia##br#
"Ah, %n%. It's you again. Have you changed your mind about that love potion?#br#
 I assure you—it's foolproof!" Calixia shoots you a salacious wink. #M332020$Calixia$822$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Your mind fills with visions of—but no! NO! You shake your head to clear#br#your thoughts and quickly tell Calixia why you've come.#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Calixia##br#
"Another pity! It would do you some good, too, but alas, if it's simply herbs you've#br#
 come for, there's no point in trying. Now, normally I don't just sell these herbs, you know!#br#
 But for the Falcons? I would do anything! Especially if the request is coming from YOU, dear."#br# Calixia bats her eyes. You wonder if everyone in this town is enamored with you.
   #M332020$Calixia$821$51$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#

"Get your fresh chops here! Fellswine, Quackadactyl, Fen Croaker—you name#br#
 it, we got it! No veggies, just red, wriggling meat, juicy and fresh for your table!#br#
 Get the cut of the day before they're picked clean!" Bella shouts carnivorous#br#
 greetings to the occasional passerby, pleased as punch. #M501010$Bella$822$51$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You hand Atelia's list to the fine saleswoman and fill her in on why you've come.#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Bella##br#
"Hah? What would an alchemist want with meat? I mean, I'm more than#br#
 happy to supply it, but it does seem awful strange now, doesn't it?"#br#
 Bella gives her noggin a confused scratching as she peruses the list. #M501010$Bella$1$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Unfortunately, you don't have an answer for her, so you simply shrug.#br#
 Alchemists work in mysterious ways, after all...#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Bella##br#
"Bwahaha, lookit you. Don't look so forlorn! In the end, I don't give a rat's patootie#br# what she wants the meat for. All that matter's is she needs it! And that's what I'm here#br#
 for. I'll have those chops to her ASAP. I can, uh, just stick it on the Falcon tab, right?"#br#
 Bella surreptitiously brings a hand to the side of her mouth, eyebrow raised.  
     #M501010$Bella$821$51$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You nod zealously, bid the fine lady farewell, then head on your way. #char$$4$$0$0#|
10510|Atelia says there's an uncorrupted flower field in Sporefall Core. Its creatures may provide some good alchemical materials for neutralizing corruption.

When you get back, she asks you to collect Sapphire Blossoms and Stoneskin Mantis Shells over in Sporefall Core.|
10511|#&7$Agatha##br#
"So... off to Sporefall Core next, I presume?"#br#
 Agatha's voice remains listless, but she's obviously concerned#br#enough about you to check up on your progress. #M320090$Agatha$1$$1$0#

 those #&46$Stoneskin Mantises#, too?"#M328090$Atelia$4$$1$0#

#&7$Atelia##br#
"That should be everything I need, yes! With those two ingredients, I will most#br#
 DEFINITELY be able to concoct some sort of potion to neutralize the local pollution.#br#

   #M328090$Atelia$824$51$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 At any rate, all of this seems par for the course with Atelia (at least given all your previous#br#
 encounters), so you don't let yourself think too hard on it. Instead, you confirm how much#br#
 of each material she needs before heading off to #&46$pick yourself a few flowers#!#char$$826$$0$0#|
10512|#&7$Agatha##br#
"You back with those materials, yet? Chop chop! Atelia hasn't got all day." #M320090$Agatha$4$$1$0#|

 It would have taken me SO long if I'd attempted it on my own. Thank you truly." #M328090$Atelia$4$$1$0#|
10520|Atelia hands you a pouch of her newest creation—Sapphire Blossom Powder! Seems this shiny, blue dust is more than just a fancy glitter for birthday cards—it should actually be able to neutralize the corruption imbued within the forest's plant life.

Atelia asks that you give it a test-run by sprinkling it on some of the wilting flowers within Sporefall Core.|
10521|#&7$Atelia##br#
"Now, if you'll just give me the teensiest moment..." Atelia procures#br#
 a medicine bowl (from who knows where) and immediately begins#br#
 grinding and mixing the ingredients. #M328090$Atelia$2$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 As she works, she begins humming a little song. It isn't until her voice gradually#br#
 gets louder that you realize it's some sort of incantation. You notice the powder in the#br# bowl glowing at first faintly, and then with a brilliant radiance that captivates your#br#
 very being. You stare at it, slack-jawed.#char$$823$$0$0#

#&7$Atelia##br#
"And THERE we are!" Atelia gives the bowl a little shake to settle the powder, then#br# carefully pours it into a small pouch. "Here you are, %n%. Homemade #&46$Sapphire##br#
 #&46$Blossom Powder#, fresh out of the mortar! If my calculations are correct, this powder#br#
 should be able to neutralize the aberrant energy plaguing the forest..."#M328090$Atelia$821$51$1$0#

#&7$Atelia##br#
"I have one last task for you, if you would be so kind. Take this powder to the northern#br#
 part of Sporefall Core and #&46$sprinkle a bit of it on any wilting flowers you can find#.#br#
 Monitor it for any changes, then report the—hopefully positive—results back to me." #M328090$Atelia$4$51$1$0#

 take off for the core. You're a bit excited to see this powder in action yourself...#char$$806$$0$0#|
10522|#&7$Agatha##br#
"A powder that can neutralize corrupted energy? Interesting.#br#
 Seems too good to be true, but I suppose we'll never know unless we test it." #M320090$Agatha$4$$1$0#|

#&7$Agatha##br#
"Well, I'll be! Not half-bad, Atelia. Not half-bad.#br#
 This powder... we can use it to restore Sporefall Forest, then, correct?" #M320090$Agatha$821$$0$0#

#&7$Atelia##br#
"In theory, yes! A little sprinkle here, a little sprinkle there,#br#
 and the whole forest should be as good as new!"#br#
 Atelia mimics said sprinkling with a wave of her hand. #M328090$Atelia$821$51$1$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"In theory? A LOT of things work in theory. Like the laws outlawing manslaughter#br#
 that keep me from wrenching Pelt's head from his neck. But what about REALITY, Atelia?"#br#It seems you're not the only one who picked up on the slight misgivings in Atelia's tone. #M320090$Agatha$4$$0$0#

#&7$Atelia##br#
"Well, we'd need an exceedingly large amount of the powder to purify the entire#br#
 forest, and the aberrant energy there seems to worsen with each passing day!#br#
 Saving the entire forest might be a fool's hope..." #M328090$Atelia$826$56$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Feeling the atmosphere between your two colleagues dampen, you quickly point out#br#
 that the powder, in itself, is a great achievement already! There's no reason to be#br# discouraged just yet—not when there's still so much potential.#char$$4$$0$0#

 Astonished that he could already be onto something so quickly,#br#
 you press Agatha for more details.#char$$4$$0$0#

"Apparently, he wants YOUR help, %n%." Your eyes widen to match Agatha's.#br#

"It's to the east—in the Crystal Cluster. Sleeping like a baby."#br#

"What's wrong?" Bain turns towards you, no doubt due to the confused#br#
 expression on your face. "You wonder why you're here?"
 
   #M310091$Bain$1$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Bain must have been able to tell what you were thinking. You're silent at#br#
 first, then hesitantly nod. Bain gazes off into the swamp, his eyes narrowed.#char$$823$$0$0#

#&7$Bain##br#
"Agatha's pretty impassive when it comes to new recruits, you know.#br#
 Or at least... she was until you came along." One of Bain's eyebrows#br#
 arcs upward as he shoots you a side glance. #M310091$Bain$1$$1$0#

#&7$Bain##br#
"She has a lot more spirit, now."#br#
 Bain pauses as though about to say more. #M310091$Bain$1$$1$0#

#&7$Bain##br#
Finally, however, Bain just nods, putting an arm around your shoulder with a little shake.#br#
 "This is a good thing. Be patient, yeah?" The smile he gives you this time is somewhat#br#
commiserative, and you respond with a nod (still not sure if you completely understand#br#
 where he's going). #M310091$Bain$4$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 When Bain pulls away, you're almost disappointed. He goes back to#br#surveying the marsh, running a hand through his mussed hair.#char$$806$$0$0#

#&7$Bain##br#
"Back to the topic at hand..."#br#
 Bain chews on his bottom lip, eyes narrowing.#br#
"Go back to HQ for me and let them know that we can begin the operation?"
   #M310091$Bain$821$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You nod, giving Bain a little salute—as well as an awkward moment of hesitation#br#just in case there's anything else he wanted to say—then take off for the Falcon's Nest.#br#Seems like it's finally time to bring this reptilian son of a snail down!#char$$822$$0$0#|
10540|Agatha doesn't have any assignments for you at the moment. She suggests you take on harder assignments from the Hunters' League to further refine your skills.

Check out the bulletin board by Clerk Leliana (240, 250) for a smattering of these staggering requests!|
10541|#&7$Agatha##br#
"Just 'cuz you're a big, bad Falcon elite, now, %n%, that doesn't mean#br#
 you can slack! Never forego an opportunity to further refine your skills.#br#
 For that, I recommend you #&46$complete a few more assignments from the##br#
 #&46$Hunters' League#. You should be able to accept the more ambitious ones now, no?" #M320090$Agatha$821$$1$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"Of course, I mean... if you wanna REST, that's fine, too.#br#
 I'm not stopping you! It's your own decision to make.#br#
 Completely your own call whether or not you want to#br#
 improve..." Agatha shrugs, superficially blasé. #M320090$Agatha$4$$1$0#|
10542|#&7$Agatha##br#
"Look at you, all anxious to get out there and bust some caps!#br# Right after we just got back, too! Commendable. Really commendable!#br#
 ...or, what was that? You wanted to rest? Whatever floats your boat, I guess."
 #M320090$Agatha$4$$1$0#|
10543|#&7$Agatha##br#
"Hey! to teach you! Guess there comes a time when all mother birds have to#br#
 shed a tear, lift their leg, and violently boot their children out of the nest..."
   #M320090$Agatha$4$$1$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"But alas, you haven't reached that moment yet. There's still a thing or two I can#br#
 learn you about proper hunting technique and all that delightfulness that entails,#br#
 so listen up! Rest time's over. Chop chop, %n%, because we're back on schedule!"
     #M320090$Agatha$821$$1$0#|
10544|#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"How's it goin', squirt? Ahaha, look at me! I can't even really call you#br#
 squirt anymore, can I? With the way you're plowing through assignments,#br#
 kicking Drago-derrière, and takin' names! That Bain sure knows how to#br#
 pick 'em." #M330090$Van Pelt$4$$1$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"Sure, we get more Falcons in and out of here every day, but it's the kind#br#
 that truly shine that make a difference—and it's exactly those that we need#br#
 more of around here. Upstanding officers to lead the people, if you know#br#what I mean." #M330090$Van Pelt$1$$1$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"Now... I'm not SAAAAAYING anything, but your strength and determination#br#
 is pretty obvious to everyone around here. The only thing you lack is a bit more#br#
 experience out in the field. So, what exactly am I trying to say? I don't know! You're#br#
 a smart kid, though, so I'm sure you can figure it out." Pelt shoots you a sly wink. #M330090$Van Pelt$4$$1$0#|
10550|While Agatha and Van Pelt are arguing, Delphia nudges you and asks to speak with you in private.  

Better see what she needs!|
10551|#&7$%n%##br#
 You quickly fill everyone in on what Bain told you—about the Slithering Dragolizards,#br#
 about Bowzar, and, mostly importantly, about the fact that the giant beast is currently#br#sleeping innocently just a bit further within the Marsh Abyss.#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"Perfect! Then we can finally get something DONE around here! We go in and nab#br#
 it, then? Time's a wasting, boys!" Agatha punches her fist into her palm, eyes aglow. #M320090$Agatha$821$$1$0#

#&7$Nash##br#
"Will this one be more challenging than the LAST one, at least? I must say,#br#
 that wyvern left me more underwhelmed than the season finale of Lou Paul's#br#
 Stag Race." Nash exudes a most gratuitous sigh, eyes rolling skyward.   #M322090$Nash$826$$0$0#

#&7$Garth##br#
"Who cares how tough the bucket of bolts is! Pelt said it might be hoarding#br#
 a giant chunk of Dragocite! The rare stuff this time! None of that fool's gold.#br#
 If that's not somethin' worth fightin' for, I don't know WHAT is!"#br#
 Garth giggles—a strange sound from him—and rolls a wrench between his fingers.
   #M329090$Garth$4$54$1$0#

#&7$Atelia##br#
"MEN! All they think about is money and power and power and money.#br#
 Don't underestimate that Crocargot, boys. It's already slipped through our#br#
 fingers multiple times! And who KNOWS how much of an effect the forest#br#
 has already had on it." Atelia waggles her finger, practically snorting with indignation. #M328090$Atelia$825$58$0$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"Exactly right, Atelia. It'd be good for you boys to play it cautiously this time#br#
 as our target is a bit of a doozy. We're gonna need a foolproof strategy if we wanna#br#
 escape unscathed." Van Pelt makes his way towards the group, grim-faced. #M330090$Van Pelt$351$$1$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"%n%! You said Bain's already honed in on that thing's location?"#br#
 Pelt's eyes turn towards you. #M330090$Van Pelt$4$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You nod, filling him in on the situation as well.#br#Bain had told you the hunt could start immediately!#char$$806$$0$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"Excellent! And everyone is here now, too! You know what this means,#br#
 ladies and gents? That thing is as good as ours! Ohoho!"#br#
 Pelt rubs his hands together gleefully, mood pulling a one-eighty. #M330090$Van Pelt$824$51$1$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"Pelt, so help me God—if you leave me behind this time, I will cheerfully and#br#
 thoroughly free you from the protruding parts of your body!" Agatha takes a#br#menacing step towards Van Pelt. #M320090$Agatha$4$$0$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"Oh. Uh. Agatha. Yeah..."#br#
 Pelt looks away with an abrupt cough, covering his mouth.#br#
 "It's just, well, we have a shortage of people back here in the nest..." #M330090$Van Pelt$826$56$1$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
Agatha takes another step forward, her armor clanking from the impact.#br#
 "PELT. I refuse to-... no! I don't refuse! I laugh! I laugh at the fact that your#br#ignorant, half-baked, skirt-chasing piece of flab you call a brain actually#br#thinks you can keep me from this hunt!" #M320090$Agatha$4$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You have a feeling this isn't going to end well.#br#
 As Agatha and Pelt's voices continue to get louder,#br#you feel a soft tap on your back, and quickly turn around.#char$$2$$1$0#

#&7$Delphia##br#
"Come with me a second, would you, %n%?"#br# Delphia whispers in your ear.
   #M327090$Delphia$4$$0$0#|
10552|#&7$Agatha##br#
"I'M PUTTING MY FOOT DOWN, PELT."#br#
 Agatha looks like she's about to explode. #M320090$Agatha$4$$1$0#|
10553|#&7$Agatha##br#
"I'M PUTTING MY FOOT DOWN, PELT."#br#
 Agatha looks like she's about to explode. #M320090$Agatha$1$$1$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"OK, OK, OK!
 I get it, I get it! Just... stop yelling... please?#br# A-and stop looking at me like you wanna dismember me!"#br#
 You return to the rest of the group just in time to see Van Pelt#br#
 get verbally and emotionally emasculated.
   #M330090$Van Pelt$826$56$0$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"That's what I thought!
 Kudos for actually thinking reasonably for once, Pelt."#br#
 You can't decide whether you're surprised or not that Agatha won in the end.#br#
 Politics in the Falcon's Nest seem an uncommonly dynamic affair. #M320090$Agatha$4$51$1$0#|
10554|#&7$%n%##br#
 You quickly sidle your way over to Delphia and find her gazing#br#off at Agatha, face filled with worry.#char$$2$$0$0#

#&7$Delphia##br#
"%n%, dear, tell me you haven't noticed it, too?#br#
 Just HOW obsessed Agatha is with that Dragomon?"#br#
 Delphia keeps her voice low, not wanting to be overheard. #M327090$Delphia$2$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Agatha's never exactly been one to do things halfway, but you admit#br#
 that even for her, this is all getting a little bit excessive. The two of you#br#
 watch Agatha argue for a few moments before turning to face each other.#char$$806$$0$0#

#&7$Delphia##br#
"It worries me. I'm afraid that she might end up doing something rash and putting#br#
 herself and others in danger. But I-... I trust you, %n%. And I know that Agatha#br#
 does, too, even if she doesn't always show it. Please look out for her?" #M327090$Delphia$4$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You wonder, almost, if Agatha is hiding something from you.#br#
 Could there be more to this whole situation than meets the eye?#br#You ask Delphia if she might know something...#char$$821$$0$0#

#&7$Delphia##br#
"I'm sorry, %n%, but that's all I can tell you right now. Perhaps-... but no.#br#
 When the time is right, maybe, but for now, I've already said too much."#br#
 Delphia's brows furrow as though she's going through some kind of intense, internal struggle. #M327090$Delphia$2$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You nod in understanding—not wanting to potentially make the situation worse—and#br#promise to keep an eye on Agatha. It's all you can do, after all...#char$$822$$0$0#|
10560|According to Bain, <Primordial Crocargot> Bowzar is currently sleeping obliviously within the Marsh Abyss. Van Pelt says that the time has come—let the hunt begin!

Quick! Take up arms and wipe out <Primordial Crocargot> Bowzar!|
10561|#&7$%n%##br#
 Just as you're about to dive into formulating a plan of attack, you feel a pair of#br#eyes watching you, and turn around to see Bain approaching the group.#char$$1$$0$0#

#&7$Bain##br#
"Let's go."#br#
 Bain's voice overwhelms you with its lack of emotion. #M310090$Bain$1$$1$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"You? What are you doing here?#br#
 You're supposed to be keeping an eye on that thing!" #M320090$Agatha$4$55$0$0#

#&7$Bain##br#
"It just finished eating. It's napping, now.#br#
 The perfect time to hunt it down."#br#
 Bain calmly seats himself on the nearby step, taking out a#br#
 whetstone and ever-so-painstakingly sharpening his blade. #M310090$Bain$821$$1$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"Excellent idea. Let's shove off, troops!#br#
 The time to end this mutant snail's reign is nigh!#br# Gussy your pretty faces up and regroup in the Marsh Abyss."
   #M330090$Van Pelt$821$$0$0#

#&7$Garth##br#
"Rooter-skoot and bob-howdy! Let's get this show on the road!" #M329090$Garth$824$51$1$0#

#&7$Nash##br#
"That supper will have been his last!
 Oh, I DO so love being poetic!" #M322090$Nash$2$$0$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"..."#M320090$Agatha$1$$1$0#

#&7$Atelia##br#
"Agatha, dear. What's wrong? You seem tense."#br#
 Atelia cocks her head inquisitively. #M328090$Atelia$4$$0$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"Nothing! Nothing at all! C'mon, %n%! Atelia! Time to jet!#br#
 I've been waiting for this moment my whole LIFE! No need#br#
 to prolong the sweet, sweet, self-gratification." Agatha clenches her#br#fist with a sadistic grin, but there's something about it that still looks forced. #M320090$Agatha$2$51$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Thinking back to your conversation with Delphia, you can't help the#br#burgeoning feeling that Agatha is, indeed, hiding something from you.#br#
 You only hope it won't complicate the upcoming hunt...#char$$826$$0$0#|
10562|#&7$Agatha##br#
"Finally! The moment I've been waiting for! I can practically TASTE it.#br#
 %n% Go to the Marsh Abyss!" #M320090$Agatha$825$$1$0#|
10563|#&7$Agatha##br#
"Everyone, I-... I'm..."#br# Agatha looks a bit worse for the wear. Fortunately, her outward injuries, at#br#
 least, proved to be of minor concern. You're not so sure about the inner ones, though...#br#
   #M320090$Agatha$102$$1$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"What in BLAZES is wrong with you, Agatha? Do you have any idea what you put #br# me through?! Not only did you put your OWN life in danger, you endangered the#br#
 rest of the team! We were forced to go barreling in there like chickens with our heads#br#
 cut off! We're lucky we made it out of there alive!" You've never seen Pelt this mad before.
   #M330090$Van Pelt$825$55$0$0#

#&7$Atelia##br#
"Van, oh, Van, darling, that's not REALLY necessary, is it? Come now...#br#
 Yes, it wasn't, erm, the most iDEAL situation, but we did all pull through#br#
 unscathed and the operation was completed successfully, yes?"#br#
 Atelia gives Pelt's shoulder a (hopefully) calming series of pats. #M328090$Atelia$2$58$1$0#

#&7$Garth##br#
"True enough. And really, Pelt. You of all people should understand#br#
 her reasoning behind it—rash enough as her actions may have been."#br# Garth scratches the back of his neck with an awkward chuckle.
   #M329090$Garth$826$$0$0#

#&7$Bain##br#
"If it wasn't for %n%, we might not have made it in time.#br#
 Perhaps you should have been more aware of the situation yourself, Van."#br#
 As much as you enjoy Bain's boosting of your ego, you really don't want#br#
 to get yourself involved in this conversation... #M310090$Bain$821$$1$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"I-... you-... FINE! Fine, OK? So maybe part of it was my fault! Does that#br#
 make you happy? But that doesn't excuse Agatha for thoughtlessly putting#br#
 hers and everyone else's lives on the line! That's not what being a part of#br#
 the Falcons is about!" Pelt jabs his finger in Agatha's direction. #M330090$Van Pelt$821$55$0$0#

#&7$Nash##br#
"Why are we all standing around bickering about such frivolous matters when#br# we could be basking in the light of the Dragocite I recovered from that fiend?"#br#
 Nash steps towards the middle of the circle, grasping said piece of #br#
 shimmering, dragonic ore between his slender fingers.
   #M322090$Nash$826$$1$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"I'M TRYING TO BE ANGRY HERE.#br#
 You know what? Fine! Just... FINE! I've had it up to here#br# with all of you, but whatever! I guess I'll just... let this slide#br#
 LIKE ALWAYS!" Pelt fumes, red-faced, but says nothing more.
   #M330090$Van Pelt$826$55$0$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"Pelt..." #M320090$Agatha$1$$1$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"Just know that there had BETTER not be a next time, Agatha!#br#
 You've got about one straw left of mine to break before I snap!#br#
 As for the Dragocite... whatever! Just take it for now. I don't even care." #M330090$Van Pelt$4$55$0$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"I apologize for my actions, Pelt. I know what I did was wrong,#br# and it won't happen again. That, I can assure you."#br#
 Agatha's voice is solemn and calm as she grimly salutes him.
   #M320090$Agatha$822$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Despite the underlying tension, it seems everything has resolved itself.#br#
 Pelt is letting things go, Agatha is safe, and Primordial Crocargot Bowzar is#br#nothing more than a memory of the past. You let out a hesitant sigh of relief.#char$$806$$0$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"All right, people. That's enough for today. Go home. Get some rest.#br# Recoup. Get yourself a refreshing beverage or two. All that fun stuff.#br#
 There'll be plenty more work starting tomorrow, but for now, pat yourselves#br#
 on the back for a successful hunt." Pelt nods, sounding somewhat defeated.
   #M330090$Van Pelt$821$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 The group gradually disperses—strangely silent—until only you and Agatha remain.#br#
 You're not quite sure what to say, so you wait for her to make the first move.#char$$2$$0$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"%n%, I-... know you must have a lot of questions."#br# Agatha's voice is dark, subdued, as she speaks to you.
   #M320090$Agatha$1$$1$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"I take full responsibility for everything that happened here.#br#
 But... you must understand that I-... have my reasons..."#M320090$Agatha$4$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You nod, a bit tentative, to let her know you're listening.#char$$822$$0$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"Do you... remember when I told you about the incident?#br# In Sporefall Forest? With the... the laboratory?"#br#
 You nod again. Of course, you remember it.#br#You've barely been able to stop thinking about it!
   #M320090$Agatha$822$$1$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"I-... it's just... all right! My father! My father was the head researcher of that lab!"#br#
 It all comes out in a rush. Agatha slams her eyes shut, taking a deep breath,#br#
 before recomposing herself and letting out a shaky breath. #M320090$Agatha$4$$1$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"He was, well, I suppose 'perfectionist' might not even come close. He strived#br#
 for perfection in everything he did. He LIVED off it, even to the point where trying#br#
 to deal with him was like punching a wall." The corners of Agatha's mouth turn#br#
 upwards at this, but only for a moment. She sighs and continues. #M320090$Agatha$821$$1$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"When... when IT happened... when everything came crashing down, he-...#br#
 my father felt it was his fault—HIS responsibility—so he tried to save as many#br#
 as he could, even when it meant-... even when it ultimately cost him his own life."#br#
 Agatha's eyes darken, and you feel your heart drop into your gut. #M320090$Agatha$1$$1$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"I guess... that's why I feel like it's my responsibility now to restore that forest#br#
 to what it once was. Sins of our fathers and all that, right? When I heard about#br#
 that mutant Dragomon and how it could be affecting the nearby ecosystems, I thought#br#
 I could be rid of it and make a change. Make a change for the better..." #M320090$Agatha$4$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Agatha falls silent, her eyes turning towards the ground. You're unsure if#br#
 she has anything more to say. After a few moments, you notice her fishing#br#around in one of her pockets.#char$$1$$0$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"Here. Pelt gave me this on the way back. Said it's for you."#br#
 She tosses a small, silver badge over with a little flick, and you jerk a hand#br#
 out to catch it. "Wanted you to know that he's pleased with your progress#br#and felt you should be promoted." #M320090$Agatha$821$$1$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"This'll make you one of the elite, now. No more piddly stuff. You're actually#br#
 a respected member amongst your fellow Falcons." Agatha crosses her arms#br#
 over her chest. "It also means a lot more responsibility, so don't go into this#br#
 thinking it's gonna be a cake walk, you got it?"   #M320090$Agatha$822$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You glance down at the badge in your hand. The brilliant gleam of its silver finish#br#
 reflects off the sun, and the elegantly carved hawk in its center appears even more#br#
 fierce than its predecessor on your bronze badge. Your eyes well up with tears at the#br#sight. You never thought a simple hunk of silver could make you so proud!#char$$806$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You know all too well you'd never have made it this far without Agatha's help.#br#
 It was her guidance (and austerity) that pushed you past limits you hadn't even#br#
 realized were there! With a respectful salute, you accept the badge and pin it to your chest.#br#You're more determined than ever, now, to fulfill your duty as a Falcon.#char$$822$$0$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"Wonderful. Now then, as for this Dragocite...#br#
 I'd like to hand it over to one of the research facilities here in Elysium.#br#
 Perhaps they'll be able to use it find a way to restore that forest.#br#
 It may be a fool's hope, but it's still a hope nonetheless." Agatha's jaw tightens resolutely. #M320090$Agatha$821$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You ask why Pelt entrusted her with the Dragocite in the first place,#br#
 and whether or not it's a good idea to just give it away like that.#br#
 The others, they... wouldn't be mad, would they?#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"I get the feeling Pelt gave it to me for exactly that reason.#br#
 He knew that's what I'd do with it..."#br#
 Agatha looks down at the chunk of warped Dragocite, eyes narrowing,#br#
 before slipping it into her pouch with a nod. #M320090$Agatha$4$51$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 There's something about Agatha's face as she tucks the Dragocite away—out of sight#br#
 and out of mind. She looks... freer, almost. As though she'd let go of the memories#br#
 that had been haunting her together with that chunk of rock.#br#Suddenly, you, too, realize why Pelt had done what he'd done.#char$$806$$0$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"I-... erm... I'm sorry... for making you put up with all this, %n%..."#br#
 Agatha averts her gaze, voice barely audible.
   #M320090$Agatha$1$56$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You're not sure if you'd been meant to hear it...
 #char$$2$$0$0#|
10564|#&7$Van Pelt##br#
 You arrive in the Marsh Abyss and immediately jog over to Pelt and the others.#br#
 Anxious to get the ball rolling, you glance around at the rest of the group, only to#br#discover that Agatha is missing. #M330090$Van Pelt$1$$1$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"We shouldn't move forward until all of us are present and accounted for.#br# According to Bain's intel, the big lummox is getting his beauty sleep in the#br#
 Crystal Cluster just over yonder. I suggest we do the same while we wait,#br#
 yeah? Charge up the ol' batteries?" Pelt glances back at Bain in search of affirmation.
  
   #M330090$Van Pelt$821$$1$0#

#&7$Bain##br#
"Assuming no surprises."#br#
 Bain doesn't even look up, still sharpening his sword atop a nearby barrel.#br#
"But... there are never any surprises with targets I've scouted."#br#
 He lifts up his sword to examine the edge of the blade, its surface reflecting in the setting sun. #M310090$Bain$1$$0$0#

#&7$Garth##br#
"Still no sign of Agatha, huh?"#br#
 Garth crosses his arms and leans back against his hammer, brow furrowed. #M329090$Garth$4$$1$0#

#&7$Nash##br#
"And here she was going ON and ON about wanting to start as SOON as#br#
 possible! Some women just can't make up their minds, it seems."#br#
 Nash languidly buffs the tip of his staff with his shirt sleeve. #M322090$Nash$826$$0$0#

#&7$Atelia##br#
"She should be here by now..."#br#
 Atelia is the only one who seems altogether concerned#br#about Agatha's lack of presence. #M328090$Atelia$2$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Something feels off. About this entire thing. It's like a strange tingle twisting#br#
 and turning in the base of your skull that sends your stomach into restless#br#
 flip-flops. She... couldn't have, could she? She wouldn't try to take on Bowzar#br#
 all by herself... WOULD she?! You relay your suspicions to Van Pelt.#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"What? You think Agatha might have gone ahead on her own?"#br#
 Pelt is silent for a moment, his eyes narrowing. Finally, he turns his head and curses.#br#
 "You know... somehow I think you might be right. This could turn bad very, VERY quickly." #M330090$Van Pelt$826$$1$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"%n%, I want you to run ahead and see if you can find anything. Don't get too close#br#
 to the thing! We just need to confirm if your suspicions are true. Everyone else—pack#br# up! We need to head out ASAP or we'll have a rescue operation on our hands!" #M330090$Van Pelt$824$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 The other Falcons respond immediately, quickly jumping to their feet, grabbing#br#
 bags, weapons, re-shouldering their armor, the like. You shoot Pelt an affirming#br#nod and take off down the path ahead, butterflies flitting about in your stomach...#char$$806$$0$0#|
10565|Meet up with the rest of the Falcon elite|
10566|Scout up ahead and look for signs of Agatha|
10567|Report back to Van Pelt|
10568|Assist your Falcon comrades in the hunt|
10569|Complete the hunt |
10570|Atelia's analysis of the atmospheric... elemental... density...—oh, whatever! The Primeval Marsh map thingie!—is too complicated for ordinary folks like you and Agatha to understand. Figures like these will require an alchemist's touch! Finding one, though, isn't exactly like hiring a plumber.

Go talk to Chairman Angel about getting in touch with the Alchemic Order. They might be your only hope...|
10571|#&7$Agatha##br#
"Give me that!" Agatha swipes the map from your hands and immediately#br# begins analyzing it. Moments later, however, she tosses it behind her.#br#
 "Too long. Didn't read. How are we supposed to understand any of that mumbo jumbo?" #M320090$Agatha$4$55$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 A startled gasp escaping your lips, you dart forward and catch the map before it falls#br#
 to the ground. You dust it off and check for signs of injury. Upon looking at it again,#br#
 you can't even tell which way is up and which way is down. The mass of numbers,#br#
 figures, and diagrams doesn't appear to have any sort of governing policy.#char$$826$$0$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"Don't waste your time, %n%. No one but an alchemist#br#
 would be able to understand that giant mass of graphite."#br#
 Agatha lets out an exaggerated sigh. #M320090$Agatha$4$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 An alchemist? Wait, hadn't Atelia mentioned something about the Alchemic#br#Order? Surely they would be able to make heads or tails of this map!#br#
 You quickly ask Agatha about contacting this mysterious order.#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"Meh... they're not really an 'order' so much as a, well... I don't even know.#br#
 An underground network of alchemists? It's one of those hush-hush, say no more#br#
 kinda things. Makes it nigh impossible for ordinary folks to try and get in touch#br# with them." She runs a hand through her hair apathetically.
   #M320090$Agatha$821$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 "Nigh impossible?!" But... but... how are you supposed to get this map deciphered,#br#then? How are you supposed to find the Primordial Crocargot?!#br#
 WHY WOULD ATELIA GIVE YOU SUCH AN IMPOSSIBLE TASK?!?#char$$826$$0$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"Cripes, don't have an aneurysm, %n%!"#br#
 You suddenly realize you'd been voicing all those "internal misgivings" out loud.#br#"Besides, I said ORDINARY people, didn't I? And since when have I ever been 'ordinary?'"#br#The corners of Agatha's mouth curl upwards in an impish smile. #M320090$Agatha$4$51$1$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"Give that map to Chairman Angel and tell him Agatha needs it deciphered, pronto!#br#
 He might, you know, ask for a small... shall we say, 'favor,' in return, but you can#br# take care of that, can't you, %n%? My oh-so-trusty trainee?"#br#
 Agatha gives you an overzealous pat on the back that almost knocks you over.  
   #M320090$Agatha$821$51$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 #&46$Chairman Angel!#  Like a true angel in disguise, he blossoms within your thoughts,#br# reawakening your hope and rejuvenating your soul. Of course! Why hadn't you#br#
 thought of the Hunters' League? They know everything! Your gaity at this revelation#br#almost makes you forgive Agatha for pawning you off again. Almost.#char$$823$$0$0#|
10572|...|
10573|#&7$Angel##br#
"Howdy-doody, %n%!
 What can I do ya for on this fine day?" #M308060$Angel$4$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You slip Atelia's note from your pouch and hand it over, quickly explaining#br# the situation (with what you hope is a suitably desperate tone in your voice).#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Angel##br#
"What? Sloooow down, kid! I can't understand when you talk a mile a minute!#br#
 Now then, let me get this straight—you need to get in contact with the Alchemic#br#
 Order to analyze this map what's-it? Is that what I'm hearing?"#br#
 You notice Angel's eyebrow twitch ever so slightly. #M308060$Angel$826$56$1$0#|
10580|Angel assures you that he'll have an answer for you regarding Atelia's map... SOMEday. In the meantime, he needs you to complete some assignments given the league's current inundation.

As always, you say yes. At least it's something to do.|
10581|#&7$Angel##br#
"Can't thank you enough for helping out my Doreen again. It's rather#br#
 amazing how quickly her mood improves every time you come along! Anyway, uh,#br#
 if you wouldn't mind, there's still those assignments I mentioned earlier..."#br#Angel grins sheepishly, scratching the back of his neck. #M308060$Angel$824$51$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You knew this was coming, so you simply nod to show you understand (albeit#br#
 indebtedly so). You do, however, make sure to ask about the current progress#br# of Atelia's map before leaving.#char$$806$$0$0#

#&7$Angel##br#
"Oh, splendidly! Splendidly! I may have finally tracked down an alchemist! Not sure,#br#
 yet, so, uh... no promises, but trust me—your good buddy Angel has got EVERYthing#br#
 under control! No need to worry your precious little britches. So you can just get to#br#
 work on those assignments..."Angel surreptitiously urges you towards the bulletin board. #M308060$Angel$4$$1$0#|
10582|#&7$Angel##br#
"Count your blessings that you've got old Angel on your side, kid.#br#
 I'll have that tenebrous tabulation decoded in no time! Course, it would#br#
 be a lot EASIER, you know, if you could take care of some of those#br# assiiiignments..." Angel gazes conspicuously off towards the bulletin board. #M308060$Angel$4$51$1$0#|
10583|#&7$%n%##br#
 A few assignments under your belt (and a skip in your step), you and %p%#br#
 head back over to Angel to check on the progress of Atelia's map. What welcomes#br#
 you, however, is another one of Doreen's temper tantrums. Angel looks to be#br#at his wits' end.#char$$1$$0$0#

#&7$Angel##br#
"Oh god, %n%! It took you so long. I thought you were never gonna come back!#br#
 Doreen's in another one of her 'moods.' I haven't been able to get a single thing#br# done! First the frying pan to the head, and now the wire hangers! I don't even#br#
 know what I did wrong, but please, just... no more wire hangers!!"
   #M308060$Angel$826$56$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You glance over at Doreen, who quickly hides one such wire hanger behind#br#
 her back. When you ask her what's wrong, though, she simply pouts, her ears#br#
 drooping to the ground. She looks positively miserable!#char$$4$$0$0#|
10590|Agatha informs you that tracks of the indomitable <Megadactyl> Pteros have recently been discovered in the Marna Heights.

10591|#&7$Agatha##br#
"Ever since Bowzar started mucking things up around here, we've witnessed a lot of#br#

10610|The more you and Agatha work together, the more her attitude towards you changes. She's gone from reluctant to teacher to not-quite-so-reluctant friend! Well, to YOU at least. You only hope the feeling is mutual.

As the two of you are pondering your next course of action, you overhear Nash reporting in to Delphia, but something appears to have gone horribly wrong. Agatha drags you over ASAP to investigate.|
10611|#&7$Agatha##br#
"That being said, there's not exactly a lot going on here now that that calamity#br#
 in the marsh's been taken care of. What to do, what to do..."#br#Agatha taps her chin in thought. #M320090$Agatha$4$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You ponder for a moment yourself, but find yourself equally as stumped.
 #char$$826$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 No sooner had this paucity of ideas plagued your mind when you hear#br#Nash's voice—elegantly caustic, as always—from across the nest.#br#
 It seems he's just returned from an assignment.#char$$2$$0$0#

#&7$Nash##br#
"Was simple as riding a bear, really! But when is that ever in doubt when#br#
 I've been assigned to the task, hm?" Nash sweeps back his bangs with a wave of his hand. #M322090$Nash$821$51$1$0#

#&7$Delphia##br#
"That's wonderful news, Nash. I'm always glad to hear of your success."#br#
 Delphia begins jotting something down in her ledger. #M327090$Delphia$822$51$0$0#

#&7$Delphia##br#
"But hm? Where is Lenora? Didn't she accompany you back from the Viridian Forest?#br#
 I'll need to speak with both of you before I can give you your next assignment." #M327090$Delphia$4$$0$0#

#&7$Nash##br#
"Ah. Erm. Lenora? She's regrettably flown the coop, it seems."#br#
 Nash's ever-present smirk falters for a second. #M322090$Nash$4$56$1$0#

#&7$Delphia##br#
"Flown the coop?! Wh-what does THAT mean?!"#br#
 Delphia reels back in horror. #M327090$Delphia$823$$0$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"But hm? Where is Lenora? "What in the world? C'mon, %n%. We should see what's going on."#br#
 She grabs your wrist without warning and promptly drags you#br#
 over to where Delphia has already begun wringing her hands. #M320090$Agatha$351$52$1$0#|
10612|...|
10613|#&7$Agatha##br#
"Cripes, Delphia. Ever heard of the cry heard round the world?" #M320090$Agatha$4$$0$0#

#&7$Delphia##br#
"But... but... but Agatha! It's dreadful! It seems that Lenora#br#
 has gone missing! What are we to do?"#br#Delphia's normally cheery features are etched with worry. #M327090$Delphia$2$$1$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"Lenora? But she was out on an assignment with you,#br# wasn't she, Nash? What exactly happened out there?"#br#
 Agatha's eyes narrow as she turns icily towards Nash.
  #M320090$Agatha$4$$0$0#

#&7$Nash##br#
"I am not her keeper!" Nash takes a step back, thoroughly affronted.#br#
 "We simply got separated amidst the chaos of the assignment!#br#
 I DID search for her, but when my efforts proved fruitless,#br#I found no point in wasting my time further and simply returned." #M322090$Nash$4$$1$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"Amidst the chaos of the assignment, huh? More like amidst the incessant#br# rigmarole that spews out of that fly trap of yours 24/7! I'd have hightailed#br#
 it outta there myself! I don't know HOW Pelt puts up with you." #M320090$Agatha$821$$0$0#

#&7$Nash##br#
"I am absolutely oFFENDED that you think I angered her in any way!#br#
 I did nothing to provoke her—truly! I looked away for a single moment,#br#
 and she was simply gone! Vamoose!" Nash's lower lip pokes out in a childish pout. #M322090$Nash$4$$1$0#

#&7$Nash##br#
"Perhaps she merely felt ashamed basking in the aura of my utter supremacy.#br#
 It is SO hard walking amongst peasants when you're meant to live in the clouds,#br#
 after all." Nash brings a hand to his chest with an over-embellished flick of his wrist. #M322090$Nash$821$51$1$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
 "Oh, go shove a turd in your mouth!" Agatha groans in exasperation. #M320090$Agatha$826$53$0$0#|
10620|Despite Nash's insistence that he has no idea why Lenora would have run off, Agatha and Delphia know enough about Lenora to get a provisional grasp of the situation. After all, when Nash is involved, feelings are bound to get hurt.

As Delphia is a good friend of Lenora, she requests to lead the search party herself, but she'll need your and Nash's help to if she's to have any success. Head over to the Viridian Forest to start the search!|
10621|#&7$Delphia##br#
"I believe Nash is telling the truth about Lenora's disappearance, Agatha—at least#br#
 about her lack of communication. She always has been a bit... withdrawn. She's much#br#
 more likely to simply run away from a problem rather than make herself heard." #M327090$Delphia$4$$1$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"You make a good point. Probably had it up to here with this overweening#br#
 princess and just took off. No one'd be able to make themselves heard over#br#
 his self-serving monologues, anyway!"
   #M320090$Agatha$4$$0$0#

#&7$Nash##br#
"I take offense to that 'overweening' comment!"#br#
 Nash tries to push his way back into the conversation,#br#
 but is effectively ignored. #M322090$Nash$4$$0$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"What do you think we should do, Delphia?" #M320090$Agatha$4$$0$0#

#&7$Delphia##br#
 Delphia chews anxiously on her bottom lip, pupils practically trembling.#br#
"Would you... be able to keep a watch on things here in the nest for a while,#br#
 Agatha? I'd like to go out and search for Lenora myself." #M327090$Delphia$4$$1$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"You can count on me! Figured you'd wanna do as much.#br#
 You're one of her closest friends here in the Order, after all."#br#
 Agatha shoots Delphia an energetic thumbs-up. #M320090$Agatha$821$$0$0#

#&7$Delphia##br#
"Thank you, Agatha."#br#
 Relief washes over Delphia's face. #M327090$Delphia$822$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Wanting to help, but not wanting to (possibly) intrude, you#br#surreptitiously raise your hand in a show of good faith.#char$$821$$0$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"You have to take a piss, %n%? Oh, or are you offering to help?#br#
 Suppose it couldn't help—not anything for you to do around here#br#
 at the moment anyway. Delphia could use any help she can get." #M320090$Agatha$4$$1$0#

#&7$Delphia##br#
"The assignment took place in the #&46$Viridian Forest#.#br#
 Nash, dear, could you please take us to the last place you saw her?" #M327090$Delphia$4$$1$0#|
10622|#&7$Agatha##br#
"From the looks of the report, the assignment itself should have been pretty simple..."#br#
 Agatha mumbles to herself as she glances over Delphia's notes. #M320090$Agatha$821$$1$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"%n%? What are you still doing here?#br# Aren't you meeting up with Delphia and Nash?#br#
 They already left! Get going!" #M320090$Agatha$4$$1$0#|
10623|#&7$Agatha##br#
"What's the buzz, %n%? You guys find Lenora?"   #M320090$Agatha$4$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You relay the events that transpired in the forest to Agatha, adding that#br#
 Delphia should already have brought Lenora back to rest by now.#char$$821$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Almost as if on cue, Delphia emerges from a nearby building#br#and begins walking your way. #M327090$Delphia$351$$1$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"Ah! There you are. What's the word? Lenora all right?" #M320090$Agatha$4$$0$0#

#&7$Delphia##br#
"Oh, she'll be just fine. The poor thing really wore herself out!#br#
 She'll need a bit of time to recover, but she should soon be right as#br# rain! I still have to wonder, though, just what would have caused her#br#
 to run off on her own like that..." #M327090$Delphia$4$$1$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"I think every one of us here knows it was 'cuz of Nash and all that#br# self-aggrandizing flim-flam spewing from his mouth." #M320090$Agatha$821$$0$0#

#&7$Delphia##br#
 "Hmm... thinking back over the situation, I believe I may have an idea of just#br#
what occurred. Nash, as you can probably imagine, is quite fond of his spells,#br#
 yes? He boasts an arsenal of wide-range attacks that can take out many Dragomon#br#
 at once." Delphia glances in the aforementioned vainglorious mage's direction. #M327090$Delphia$4$$1$0#

#&7$Delphia##br#
"However, he oftentimes uses these disproportionate spells when they're not needed,#br#
 and, in this case, I believe he may have been harming the local Quackadactyls in#br#
 addition to the Pantherus he was supposed to be hunting. Lenora, soft-hearted as she#br#
 is, was, no doubt, angered by this and could tolerate it no more." #M327090$Delphia$821$$1$0#

#&7$Delphia##br#
"Poor Lenora is so timid that she would never have been able to stand up against#br#
 Nash! Well, admittedly, even some of our most assertive members can't stand up to#br#
 Nash, but whatever the case, his actions must have outraged her to the point where#br#she couldn't stand it anymore and simply left." #M327090$Delphia$4$$1$0#|
10624|#&7$Delphia##br#
"Lenora! Oh, Lenora! Are you all right?"#br#
 Delphia rushes over to Lenora's side, pulling her into her arms. #M327090$Delphia$4$$0$0#

#&7$Lenora##br#
"D-... Delphia... what are you... doing here?"#br#
 Lenora's breath catches in the back of her throat with every#br#word as she fights to regain her footing. #M324091$Lenora$503$$1$0#

#&7$Nash##br#
"What a homely duckling. Looks no different from any of its fellow#br#
 kin. Why on earth did you feel the need to practically throw your#br#
 life away for it?" Nash walks over, holding the Quackadactyl#br#Lenora had been trying to protect. #M322090$Nash$4$$0$0#

#&7$Lenora##br#
"N-... NASH! You-!!!"#br#
 Lenora looks as though she wants to forcibly unscrew Nash's head from#br#
 his body, but the impetus seems too much for her, and she abruptly#br#faints in Delphia's arms. #M324091$Lenora$825$55$1$0#

#&7$Delphia##br#
"Lenora! Oh, Lenora..."#br#
 Worry clouds Delphia's face as she gently runs a#br#hand over the other girl's forehead. #M327090$Delphia$823$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Rather worried yourself at this point, you kneel down next to the two, praying for#br#
 any sign that Lenora is still alive. A few moments later, you see her chest rise and fall,#br#and you breathe a sigh of relief. Curious, you ask Delphia if she's injured in any way.#char$$1$$1$0#

#&7$Delphia##br#
"Just a few scratches it seems, but the poor dear is exhausted!#br#
 She simply couldn't keep herself awake anymore.#br#
 I'll take her back to the nest so she can lie down... would you two be#br#
 so kind as to bring her equipment back?" #M327090$Delphia$4$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Delphia lifts Lenora into her arms—which takes you by surprise! Had you always#br#
 known Delphia to be so burly?—and leaves you and Nash alone in the grove, staring#br#at each other wordlessly. #M322090$Nash$1$$0$0#

#&7$Nash##br#
After a few moments, Nash glances down at the duck, then back at you, blinking owlishly.#br#"...what, pray tell, are we to do with this duck?" #M322090$Nash$4$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You shrug your shoulders, at a loss yourself.#br#
 Without another word, you pick up Lenora's equipment#br#from off the ground and head back towards the Falcon's Nest.#char$$826$$1$0#|
10625|Search for Lenora|
10630|So... Lenora is one of those nature-loving hippie folks, is she? Makes sense why Nash's flamboyant antics would have bothered her, then. But it seems she's bothered by more than just Nash—NONE of the other Falcon members can work with her!

This has, needless to say, made her difficult to promote, but by the looks of it, Delphia has an idea, and it might just involve YOU...|
10631|#&7$Agatha##br#
"As much as it brings me great pleasure to lay all the blame on Nash, this isn't#br#
 the first time I've heard of something like this happening with Lenora. Pelt's partnered#br#
 her up with other Falcons before only to have similar things happen." #M320090$Agatha$4$$1$0#

#&7$Delphia##br#
"Indeed. The poor thing... Her personality can be a bit wearisome at times, it's true.#br#
 It's given Van more than a few headaches of his own, and it's why she's yet to be#br#
 able to pass the test for her promotion. Quite incommodious for all of us."#br#
 Saying this, Delphia glances over at you, and suddenly you catch a tiny glint in her eye. #M327090$Delphia$826$$1$0#|
10632|...|
10633|#&7$Delphia##br#
"%n%, deeeear! I do hope I'm not troubling you too much, it's just that... well... someone#br#
 who can put up with Agatha could SURELY do something to help our poor Lenora, right?#br#
 So I was wondering if, perhaps, just maybe, you would be willing to be her temporary#br#
 partner until she's completed her exam..." Delphia's big brown eyes blink imploringly. #M327090$Delphia$4$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Delphia's choice of words regarding Agatha makes every nerve in your body#br#
 tense up, but—to your great surprise—Agatha barely even reacts.#char$$823$$0$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"Actually, that's a pretty good idea. I say we go for it." #M320090$Agatha$4$$1$0#|
10640|As you seem to get along SO well with SO many different people—your ability to put up with Agatha being evidence enough—Delphia believes you're the perfect candidate to help Lenora through her upcoming evaluation.

Unfortunately, this also seems to include wooing her with expensive, silken fabrics. Who knew? Nothing to be done, however, so you might as well get to the Viridian Forest and collect some of those pupae!|
10641|#&7$Delphia##br#
"Oh, perfect! If Agatha agrees, then it should be no problem at all! It will only#br#
 be for a short while, don't worry—you won't be stuck with her forever, ohoho!#br#
 But do try and help her as best you can? I just KNOW someone like you would be able#br#to help her, %n%." Delphia's warm smile melts your heart. #M327090$Delphia$822$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You wave off her praise with an embarrassed shake of your head and reassure#br#
 the pinkette that you're more than happy to be of assistance. The Falcons have#br#done so much for you, after all.#char$$821$$0$0#

#&7$Delphia##br#
"Ah! Before the two of you meet, there's one small thing I'd ask you to do first, dear.#br#
 Could you pay another visit to the Viridian Forest and bring back a#br##&46$glimmering Mothrake pupa#?" She tilts her head to the side in curious inquisition. #M327090$Delphia$4$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Normally, you don't ask about even the strangest requests you get, but you#br#can't help your current curiosity—you ask whatever for?#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Delphia##br#
"You see, the pupae of Mothrakes emit a very soft, shimmering light. These pupae#br#
 can also be used to make wonderfully smooth silk! The combination is truly to die for." #M327090$Delphia$4$$1$0#

#&7$Delphia##br#
"Dear Lenora absolutely aDORES these types of fabrics! I believe an offering of this#br#
 silk would make quite the impression on her. It may even lift her spirits enough#br#
 to help her succeed in her examination." Delphia shoots you a crafty wink. #M327090$Delphia$821$51$1$0#|
10642|#&7$Angel##br#
"Yeesh, this influx of assignments just never stops! What happened to all my bright-eyed,#br# bushy-tailed hunters who'd normally be flocking to them like flies on dung?"#br#Angel laments to himself while slogging through a pile of paperwork. #M308060$Angel$826$$1$0#|
10643|#&7$%n%##br#
 It's been a while since you've talked to the good chairman! A smile on your face,#br#
 you approach him with sticky pupae in tow, filling him in on your current plight#br#and the request from Delphia.#char$$821$$0$0#

#&7$Angel##br#
 "So... you need some silk from these babies, do ya? Ohoho! I'd do anything for my#br#
darling Delphia! Well, I mean, for any of my Falcon compatriots, of course."#br#
 Angel takes the pupae from your hands and places them in a small sack. "I know a few#br#
 people who know a few people who just may be able to help you with your sticky request." #M308060$Angel$4$51$1$0#|
10644|#&7$Delphia##br#
 Proud of your pupae-collecting skills, you flaunt the five, sticky Mothrake pods you#br#
found in the forest in front of Delphia, who clasps her hands together with a smile.#br#
 "Oh, wonderful! These will do just marvelously. We should be able to make fine#br#silk from these!" #M327090$Delphia$4$51$1$0#

#&7$Delphia##br#
"For the actual silk production, however, we'll need to rely on a bit of outsourcing.#br#
 Could you take those pupae to #&46$Chairman Angel#? He should know just the person."#br# #M327090$Delphia$4$$1$0#

#&7$Delphia##br#
"That actually reminds me... the dear chairman has been up to his ears in work lately,#br#
 what with so many assignments not being filled. As it will take a while for the silk to#br#
 be finished anyway, why don't you be an 'angel' and help our own poor Angel tackle a#br#few of those pesky assignments? He'd be most appreciative, I'm sure." #M327090$Delphia$821$$1$0#|
10645|Find the Mothrake habitat|
10650|Your new partnership with Lenora gets off to a somewhat rocky start—you never were one to enjoy being ignored—but after some prodding from Delphia, Lenora agrees to partner up with you for her next assignment.

Said assignment includes traveling to the Viridian Forest to collect some allium bulbs for an herbal remedy she's making!|
10651|#&7$%n%##br#
 Glimmering spool of silk in your hands, you make your way back to the Falcon's Nest#br#
 and find Lenora conversing with Delphia. Cavalier smile plastered across your#br#self-satisfied face, you offer her the much-sought-after textile. #M324090$Lenora$1$$1$0#

#&7$Lenora##br#
 Much to your eternal dismay, Lenora barely even glances at you.#br# She seems confused and at a bit of a loss, then simply turns away#br#
 without a word. #M324090$Lenora$4$$1$0#

#&7$Delphia##br#
"Oh, how sweet! Look, %n% has offered you a gift! Perhaps this is their way of saying#br#
 they'd like to go out on an assignment with you, Lenora. Why don't you give it a try?" #M327090$Delphia$821$$0$0#

#&7$Lenora##br#
 Lenora is still for a moment, her eyes searching Delphia's face, then—finally—she turns#br#
 back to you and bashfully accepts the spool of silk. Avoiding your eyes completely,#br#she keeps her gaze trained on the silky fabric.#char$$1$$0$0#

#&7$Lenora##br#
"I... I need allium bulbs to complete the herbal remedy I'm working on..."#br#
 You remain silent, waiting for her to continue, but she doesn't.#br#
 She simply clenches the spool of fabric tightly to her chest. #M324090$Lenora$821$$1$0#

#&7$Delphia##br#
"Ahahaaa... I, erm, believe what Lenora is trying to say, %n%, is that she'd very much#br#
 love your assistance in collecting a few #&46$allium bulbs#. You should be able to find plenty#br#
 over in the Viridian Forest, hm? Just look around for #&46$foxtail grasses#, as they are#br#what grow from the bulbs. Would you be able to help her with this, %n%?" #M327090$Delphia$4$$1$0#|
10652|#&7$Delphia##br#
"I apologize for Lenora's... how should I put it? Standoffishness? She just has#br#
 a bit of a problem, erm... opening up to people! Yes. She's just a bit shy, is all.#br#
 But once you get to know her, you'll see she's a lovely person!" #M327090$Delphia$822$$1$0#

#&7$Delphia##br#
"This assignment is a good opportunity to get to know her better! Perhaps if#br#
 you get her to trust you, she'll feel more comfortable bearing her heart, so to speak." #M327090$Delphia$4$$1$0#|
10653|#&7$Delphia##br#
"Oh, Lenora! %n% is back! You should come out and see them."#br#
 Delphia turns towards Lenora, currently feigning sleep, and gives#br#her a little poke in the side. #M327090$Delphia$821$$1$0#

#&7$Lenora##br#
 Lenora stretches her arms above her head with an ostentatious yawn before#br#getting to her feet. She walks over to you in silence and holds out her hand. #M324090$Lenora$1$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Morphing your face into what you hope is an especially friendly, warm, welcoming#br#expression, you pull the allium bulbs from your pouch and place them in her palm.#char$$822$$0$0#

#&7$Lenora##br#
 Bulbs in hand, Lenora gets to work immediately. She wanders over to the blanket she'd#br#
 been resting on and procures a mortar and pestle, using them to grind the bulbs into#br#a fine powder. She then mixes another strange-colored powder to the mix, and all of a#br#sudden, the concoction begins to radiate the most unholy of stenches. #M324090$Lenora$821$$1$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
 The rancid odor is even too much for Agatha (currently peeping over Delphia's shoulder),#br#
 and the normally stoic purplette pinches her nose in a panic and staggers away. #M320090$Agatha$823$53$1$0#

#&7$Lenora##br#
 Strangely enough, Lenora seems immune to the iniquitous scent and simply continues#br#
 with her mixing. Once she deems the matrimony of powders thoroughly mixed,#br#she pours it into two separate gallipots. #M324090$Lenora$4$$1$0#|
10660|Good golly, Miss Molly, you've never smelled anything so revolting in your life! You have no idea what the powder is that Lenora whipped up using those allium bulbs, but at this point, you're not even sure you WANT to know.

Once it's complete, she states that you now need to take care of a few Scarlet Fangsaurs over in Echo Valley. You're not sure if the two things are related, but you'll need to get over there no matter what!|
10661|#&7$Lenora##br#
"We... we need to go to Echo Valley and #&46$ward off the Scarlet Fangsaurs#."#br#
 Lenora continues nonchalantly, as though she hadn't just ravaged the nasal#br#cavities of everyone in the Falcon's Nest. #M324090$Lenora$821$$1$0#

#&7$Lenora##br#
 Saying nothing more, she turns and makes her way towards the nearest gearcopter.#br#Apparently, you're, uh, supposed to follow her? #M324090$Lenora$351$$1$0#

#&7$Delphia##br#
"Good luck on your assignment, you two! I look forward to hearing#br#
 ALL about it..." Delphia waits until Lenora walks a few steps away before#br#shooting you another one of her all-knowing winks. #M327090$Delphia$4$51$1$0#|
10662|#&7$Delphia##br#
"Isn't Lenora waiting for you, dear? You should hurry along!" #M327090$Delphia$823$$1$0#

#&7$Delphia##br#
"Your assistance is needed in Echo Valley. It seems a number of Scarlet Fangsaurs#br#
 are disturbing the locals there. Please help Lenora in teaching them a lesson, yes?"#br#
 Delphia glances through her notes to confirm the assignment's objectives. #M327090$Delphia$1$$1$0#

#&7$Delphia##br#
"Lenora should be there by now. Hurry now! You don't want to keep her waiting."
   #M327090$Delphia$4$$1$0#|
10663|#&7$%n%##br#
 You return to the Falcon's Nest with Lenora, the two of you still laughing and reminiscing#br#
 about the outcome of your assignment. You're surprised to find not only Delphia#br#and Agatha awaiting your arrival, but Van Pelt, as well.#char$$823$$0$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"Having fun, %n%?"#br#
 You're about to respond that, yes! You are, in fact, enjoying yourself, but#br#
 then you notice Agatha's steely gaze and realize the question had been#br#lined with explosives. #M320090$Agatha$821$55$1$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"Lookit you, %n%! All grown up and makin' friends!#br#
 Why, I've never SEEN Lenora with a smile on her face like that#br#
 with anyone 'sides Delphia." Pelt offers you a jovial thump on#br#
 the back. "Oh, and Agatha..." #M330090$Van Pelt$4$51$0$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"What, PELT?!"#br#
 Agatha spins on her heels, voice crackling dangerously. #M320090$Agatha$4$$1$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"You realize recommending %n% for Lenora would effectively#br#
 nullified everything in that 'promise' we agreed on..."#br#
 Pelt crosses his arms over his chest, looking—for once—smug at having#br#obtained the high ground over Agatha. #M330090$Van Pelt$821$$0$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"What? I-... I mean... it was only, I mean... yeah..."#br#
 Agatha's rage diminishing, she turns away with a glower. #M320090$Agatha$3$$1$0#|
10664|#&7$Lenora##br#
 You approach Lenora, who's looking dismal as ever, a bit bedraggled and#br#
 nauseous. As Lenora takes in the sight of you covered in powder, she brings#br#a hand up to cover her mouth. #M324091$Lenora$824$51$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Afraid that something might be wrong, you quickly ask what's the matter.#char$$821$$0$0#

#&7$Lenora##br#
"No, it's just... it's just..." All of a sudden, Lenora breaks out in riotous laughter.#br#
 She has to hold her stomach as tears build up in the corners of her eyes. #M324091$Lenora$821$$1$0#

#&7$Lenora##br#
"You... you... all you needed to do was scatter a little of the powder here and there!#br#
 It would have acted as a repellent to keep the Fangsaurs away from the village.#br#
 I-... I've never... I've never seen anyone COVER themselves in the powder before...!!"#br#Lenora can barely control herself by this point. #M324091$Lenora$824$51$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 It hadn't exactly been your PLAN to douse yourself with the offensive dust, but upon#br#
 seeing Lenora in such high spirits, you find it unnecessary to reveal what really happened.#char$$826$$0$0#

#&7$Lenora##br#
 Lenora brings her hands to her face, wiping back the tears now streaming down#br#
her cheeks. "I'm... I'm glad, though... I was afraid you would just kill them like so#br#
 many other people I've worked with..."
   #M324091$Lenora$821$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 A trickle of apprehensive sweat tickles its way down from your temple upon hearing#br#
 this—that's exactly what you WOULD have done had you not accidentally broken#br#
 that pot! Thank God for small miracles?#char$$823$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 At any rate, Lenora seems much more comfortable around you already, and you're#br#
 starting to understand her point of view, as well. It might be a dog-eat-dog world out#br#there, but that doesn't mean you should kill for killing's sake. Every life is important, after all...#char$$1$$0$0#|
10665|Drive away the Scarlet Fangsaurs|
10666|Meet Lenora at the entrance to Echo Valley|
10670|Now that you and Lenora have become the best of friends, Delphia wonders if maybe the two of you couldn't tackle your examinations together, and, upon Van Pelt's approval, you're instantly thrust into your first task.

You're to collect feathers from the Arashi Ireclaws that proliferate Echo Valley. A simple enough task, but not quite so when taking into account Lenora's aversion to violence. Fortunately, a new invention from Garth may remedy this roadblock...|
10671|#&7$Delphia##br#
"You know, Van, seeing as Lenora and %n% seem to work so well together,#br#
 why don't we have them take their examinations together?" #M330090$Van Pelt$1$$0$0#

#&7$Lenora##br#
 Lenora's eyes widen in surprise, and she glances back and forth between Delphia and#br#
 Pelt. "I-... but you..." She presses her lips together, brows furrowing momentarily,#br#
 before she nods her head in affirmation. "I... I would like that. If you would let me..." #M324090$Lenora$1$$1$0#

#&7$Delphia##br#
"I know that %n% would normally not have enough experience, yet, to take#br#
 their exam, but given Lenora's... 'situation,' and the fact that all examinees must#br#
 work in pairs, don't you think it would be possible to bend the rules just slightly?#br#
 Delphia clasps her hands behind her back, batting her eyelashes in Pelt's direction. #M327090$Delphia$4$$1$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"I, erm, heheh... I mean... o-of course!" Pelt barks out as if he were high on helium.#br#
 He quickly coughs into his hand, voice returning to its normal pitch.#br#
 "I mean, of course! Yes, I think that proposal would mutually benefit all parties involved..." #M330090$Van Pelt$4$$0$0#

#&7$Lenora##br#
 You glance over at Lenora and see her face light up. #M324090$Lenora$822$51$1$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"All right, then!" Pelt punches his palm in a desperate attempt to regain his footing#br#
 as respected Falcon leader. "Your first order of the day is to bring back a fistful of#br#
 #&46$feathers# from those pesky Arashi Ireclaws over in Echo Valley!" #M330090$Van Pelt$821$$0$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
 Grabbing both of you—one in each arm—he gives you twin shakes of encouragement.#br#
"Good luck, you two! Not that I think you need it!" He winks. "I'd love to stay and#br#
 await your triumphant return, but seeing as I've some other appointments to attend to,#br#I must be off! Looking forward to hearing the good news." #M330090$Van Pelt$351$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Knowing right off the bat that slaying the Ireclaws for their feathers wouldn't exactly#br#
 be Lenora's cup of tea, you inquire as to whether or not there's a less... GRISLY way#br#of collecting the necessary feathers.#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"What are you talking about? Just stab the things and-..."#br#
 Agatha's eyes turn quickly towards Lenora, whose own#br#
 gaze has turned murderous. #M320090$Agatha$4$$1$0#

#&7$Delphia##br#
 "Hmm... I might have an idea!" Delphia procures a handful of tiny beads from her pouch,#br#
holding them out for all to see. "These are one of Garth's latest inventions. He said there#br#might still be a few kinks, but he'd like if someone could give them a test run." #M327090$Delphia$821$$1$0#

#&7$Delphia##br#
"What was it he called them again? Ah, yes! #&46$Hypnobombs#! From the explanation#br#
 he gave me, it sounds as if they burst open upon contact with a target and release a#br#
 gaseous mixture with properties similar to chloroform. Something like this could be#br#just what you need to complete your assignment." #M327090$Delphia$4$$1$0#

#&7$Lenora##br#
 Lenora's eyebrows raise in curious excitement, and she takes the Hypnobombs from#br#
Delphia's hands. "Oh, thank you, Delphia... These sound very interesting." #M324090$Lenora$822$51$0$0#

#&7$Delphia##br#
"It's my pleasure, dear. Do let me know how effective they are, would you?#br# Garth will be champing at the bit to know how they fare in combat.#br#
 At any rate, you should be running along—it will be dark soon!" #M327090$Delphia$4$51$1$0#|
10672|#&7$Delphia##br#
"Lenora is truly opposed to violence of any sort, even against the most#br#
 foul of beasts. You can imagine this gets her into trouble at times...#br#
 Do watch out for her, would you?" #M327090$Delphia$4$$1$0#|
10673|#&7$%n%##br#
 When you and Lenora arrive back at the Falcon's Nest, you're surprised#br#
 to see, not Van Pelt waiting for you, but Nash instead.#char$$1$$0$0#  

#&7$Delphia##br#
"Have you finished the task? Wonderful! I'll take those feathers from you, %n%.#br#
 Van has asked me to let you know he's currently tied up in a meeting, but any and#br#
 all questions can be directed towards me while you continue your examination." #M327090$Delphia$821$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You fill Delphia in on the great success of Garth's Hypnobombs. Those Ireclaws#br#
 were out like a light! You're fairly certain you could have plucked every single feather#br#from their body and they'd still be sleeping sounding.#char$$821$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 As you're talking to Delphia, however, you glance over and notice Nash#br#attempting to start up a conversation with Lenora... #M324090$Lenora$1$$1$0#

#&7$Nash##br#
"Delphia told me why you left, Lenora, and I-... wanted to apologize...#br#
 for being so POWERFUL, that is! Why, I fear that even my weakest of spells could,#br#
 unfortunately, wipe out an entire region of its life forms! It's quite troubling, actually..."#br#Nash brings the back of his hand to his forehead with exaggerated relish. #M322090$Nash$821$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Nash's mannerisms mildly make you want to clock him upside the head,#br#
 but at the same time, it seems he's at least... TRYING to apologize.#br#
 Lenora, however, is unimpressed.#char$$1$$0$0#

#&7$Nash##br#
 Lenora's lack of response—or reaction, really—triggers a slump in Nash's posture.#br#
He awkwardly plays with the edges of his hat. "Well... I suppose you two are very#br# busy. I'll let you get back to your work..." He throws a last glance back at you, then#br#wanders off towards the other end of the nest. #M322090$Nash$4$56$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Despite your inherent distaste of his attitude, you admit you feel a bit#br#sorry for him as he slithers away like a lost puppy.#char$$1$$1$0#|
10680|Your first test was a rousing success! Not only did Garth's Hypnobombs work like a charm on those Ireclaws, but you were able to bring back a fistful of feathers, to boot.

As Pelt is a bit indisposed upon your arrival back in the Falcon's Nest, Delphia informs you of your next test—hunting down the ferocious Grizzlejaws of Echo Valley!|
10681|#&7$Delphia##br#
 Delphia glances over silently at Nash's retreating form, but simply continues#br#
 on as if nothing had happened. "All right, you two. It's time for your second task, yes?#br#
You're now to travel back to Echo Valley and take on the ferocious #&46$Grizzlejaws# that#br#wander the countryside. You MUST bring back proof of your victory to pass the test." #M327090$Delphia$4$$1$0#

#&7$Delphia##br#
"Van Pelt has made it explicitly clear in the rules that these bears must be#br#
 brought down with your own strength—no trickery or extraneous apparati!"#br#
 Delphia waggles her finger in the air. #M327090$Delphia$821$$1$0#

#&7$Delphia##br#
"You'll want to be careful, though, as these beasts are quite vicious.#br#
 They may appear peaceful—even friendly!—upon first glance, but#br#they are quick to attack anything that enters their territory." #M327090$Delphia$4$$1$0#|
10682|#&7$Delphia##br#
"Those Grizzlejaws may not look particularly dangerous, but as soon#br#
 as they feel their territory is being threatened, they turn into savage beasts!#br#
 You'll want to be extra careful during this test. I don't want to have to#br#
 sew any fingers back on!" #M327090$Delphia$4$$1$0#|
10683|#&7$%n%##br#
 You and Lenora return to the Falcon's Nest posthaste and present#br#the evidence of your hunt to Delphia.#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Delphia##br#
 A strange series of glances takes place between Delphia and Lenora.#br#
 You're not sure exactly what they mean or what's transpiring, but you can#br#
 hazard a guess that Delphia's realized what happened in the valley.#br#Nevertheless, she accepts the proof of your success without comment. #M327090$Delphia$821$$1$0#|
10684|#&7$%n%##br#
 After taking care of your half of the Grizzlejaw count, you quickly jog further#br#
 into the valley to find Lenora. You're, at first, surprised to see her taking on#br#the Grizzlejaws herself, but upon taking a closer look, you see that the ones#br#she's chosen are already getting on in their years.#char$$1$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Counting up the number of bear corpses in your head, you mentally add them to#br#
 the amount you already killed. It doesn't take you long to realize Lenora hasn't#br#felled enough...#char$$823$$0$0#

#&7$Lenora##br#
 Brows furrowed, you turn your gaze towards Lenora, and you can tell she knows#br#
what you're about to say. "I-... I know! I know, all right? But I-... I don't want to hurt#br#anymore! I just can't!" #M324091$Lenora$825$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Knowing there's no way you're going to be able to change her mind, you#br#
 suggest, instead, that you take out a few more to make up for the deficiency.#char$$821$$0$0#

#&7$Lenora##br#
 Lenora is silent for a moment, thinking things over, then slowly nods.#br#She looks a bit relieved. #M324091$Lenora$822$$1$0#|
10690|You're fairly certain Delphia's realized you did a LITTLE more than your own part on the last test, but for now, at least, she's keeping her mouth shut.

10691|#&7$Delphia##br#
 "We'll now continue to the third part of your exam. It's quite similar to what#br#
you've just done, actually, but will require a bit more finesse and ingenuity.#br#
 This time, you are to hunt down #&46$Ironfang Jackals# in Echo Mine. As before,#br#
 you must face the beasts head-on using nothing but your own strength and wit." #M327090$Delphia$821$$1$0#

#&7$Delphia##br#
"Ironfang Jackals are more aggressive than Grizzlejaws, and are quicker on#br#
 their feet. This means you will need to keep a constant sharp eye about your#br#
 surroundings, as they're dangerously fond of ambushes." #M327090$Delphia$4$$1$0#|
10692|#&7$Delphia##br#
"Ironfang Jackals are pack hunters by nature. Keep a keen eye out if a number#br#
 of them ever go missing—more than likely they'll be preparing an ambush from#br#
 behind. The very thought makes me shudder!" Delphia brings a hand to her mouth. #M327090$Delphia$821$$1$0#|
10693|#&7$%n%##br#
 You and a still-upset Lenora make your way somewhat dejectedly back to the Falcon's#br#
 Nest. Upon arriving, you find Van Pelt and the rest of the Falcon elite in heated#br#discussion regarding a recently-discovered Eyedim Dragon spotted close to the city. #M330090$Van Pelt$821$$1$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"Can I count on you to clear the area for us like usual, Nash?" #M330090$Van Pelt$4$$1$0#

#&7$Nash##br#
"Say no more, good sir! I shall have that area as smooth and spotless as my l—"#br#
 Nash bows elegantly, but halfway down, his body convulses, and he lets out#br#
 a high-pitched squeak of pain. #M322090$Nash$821$51$0$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"Nash? What's wrong? Are you hurt?"#br# Pelt is to Nash's side instantly, one hand cradling the other's shoulder. #M330090$Van Pelt$821$$1$0#

#&7$Nash##br#
 "Aha... ahaha... It's nothing! Nothing, really. Just a... a little scratch." Nash pushes Pelt #br#
away, but even as he attempts an amenable smile, his hands betray his intentions, #br#
 flying immediately to his side. Pelt tsk's in the back of his throat and pulls Nash back in#br#to keep him from falling over. #M322090$Nash$4$$0$0#

#&7$Lenora##br#
 You glance over at Lenora, surprised to find her stepping forward from the crowd.#br#
"It was me. I'm the one who hurt Nash." #M324090$Lenora$4$$0$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
 Pelt turns so quickly, he almost knocks Nash to the ground.#br#
"Lenora? What in the world are you talking about?" His eyes narrow. #M330090$Van Pelt$1$$1$0#

#&7$Nash##br#
 "It, uh... it really... it wasn't her fault, I-... acted rashly, you know?#br#
Silly old Nash made her angry again..." Nash, once again, attempts to#br#
 separate himself from Van Pelt's arm to no avail. #M322090$Nash$4$$0$0#

#&7$Lenora##br#
 Lenora ignores Nash, taking another step forward. She #br#
seems more confident than you've ever seen her before.#br#
 "Those Dragomon were innocent. They'd done nothing wrong.#br#And I refuse to see more creatures killed for... for some TEST!" #M324090$Lenora$821$$0$0#

#&7$Lenora##br#
"And... and I'll have you know that if it hadn't been for %n%, I wouldn't#br#
 have passed the last test, either! They took down the Grizzlejaws when I#br#refused to go on." #M324090$Lenora$821$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Lenora's voice seems to echo out over the stunned crowd.#br#
 When she finishes, the entire nest grows so silent, you could#br#have heard a pin drop.#char$$1$$0$0#|
10694|Meet up with Lenora|
10700|You return with Lenora after the "incident" to find Pelt and the other Falcon elite discussing a new Dragomon on the prowl, but when Pelt grows concerned about Nash's injury, Lenora boldly declares that it was her doing—and admits to cheating on her exam, to boot.

Pelt, understandably, is angry. Lenora, also understandably, is upset and runs off to who-knows where. After the remaining tasks for the upcoming hunt are assigned, Agatha motions for you to come see her...|
10701|#&7$%n%##br#
 You're too scared to even breathe. Throwing fearful glances at the faces of#br#
 each of the Falcon elite, you finally land on Van Pelt. His jaw is tight, and#br#there's scarcely-contained rage brewing just behind his eyes. #M330090$Van Pelt$1$55$1$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
 When Pelt next speaks, his voice is calm, measured, but with an icy chill that#br#
makes your saliva get stuck halfway down your throat. You've never heard him#br#
 speak like this before. "Delphia, take Lenora to get some rest. We won't be needing#br#her on this mission." #M330090$Van Pelt$821$$1$0#

#&7$Delphia##br#
 Delphia nods, her expression terse. Grabbing Lenora's hand, she attempts to#br#
 pull the other woman away from the group, but Lenora refuses to budge, throwing#br#Delphia's hand aside. #M327090$Delphia$823$$0$0#

#&7$Lenora##br#
 "Have I-... disappointed you, Van?"#br#
Lenora's voice quivers, and you can see her fighting back tears. #M324090$Lenora$821$$0$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
 Pelt simply studies her in silence for a moment before nodding his head.#br#
 He turns back to Nash, clearly wanting no more part in this conversation. #M330090$Van Pelt$826$56$1$0#

#&7$Lenora##br#
 Lenora stands there motionless, lower lip trembling.#br#Then, in an abrupt eruption of tears, she takes off with a wail. #M324090$Lenora$301$57$0$0#

#&7$Delphia##br#
"L-... Lenora!"#br#
 Delphia immediately dashes after Lenora. #M327090$Delphia$301$$0$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
 An awkward silence settles over the group until, finally, Pelt claps his#br#
 hands together to grab everyone's attention.#char$$1$$0$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"All right. Since Nash is a bit worse for the wear, I'd like Bain to switch places with#br#
 him and clear the area. Nash, you'll be in charge of tracking the dragon's movements,#br# you got it? Try to keep from exerting yourself." #M330090$Van Pelt$821$$1$0#

#&7$Nash##br#
"I-... I'm fine! Truly! Give me an hour or two, perhaps, but then I'll be perfectly#br# capable! I mean, really—how could I call myself a worthy member of the#br#Falcons if I couldn't even—"#M322090$Nash$4$$0$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
Pelt cuts off Nash's desperate rambling with a hand to his mouth. "Nash."
   #M330090$Van Pelt$1$$1$0#

#&7$Nash##br#
 Nash flinches, eyes tightening before feebly turning away.#br#
"I'll... go track, then." #M322090$Nash$826$56$0$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"Bain?"#br#
 Pelt turns towards Bain, nothing more needing to be said. #M330090$Van Pelt$1$$1$0#

#&7$Bain##br#
"Got it."#M310090$Bain$822$$0$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"Agatha, could I have you keep things running smoothly here in the#br#
 nest until Delphia gets back? Let me know when she returns." #M330090$Van Pelt$4$$1$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"No problem." #M320090$Agatha$822$$0$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"If there are no further questions, you're all dismissed." #M330090$Van Pelt$821$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Everyone nods stiffly before wandering off to perform their respective tasks.#br#
 Agatha motions with her head for you to stay, so you wait until everyone's left#br#before meandering over.#char$$1$$1$0#|
10702|...|
10703|#&7$Agatha##br#
"%n%, you... don't know much about Lenora's history, do you?" #M320090$Agatha$4$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You shake your head no. To be honest, you haven't a clue.#char$$821$$0$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"Lenora, she... hasn't always been part of the Falcons. For a long time,#br#
 she was actually part of aNOTHER union, but... something happened#br#
 and she ended up getting expelled. It was actually Pelt who recruited#br#
 her for the Falcons. Took a bit of convincing, too..." #M320090$Agatha$821$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You're starting to see why Pelt's disappointment was so hard on Lenora.#char$$823$$0$0#

#&7$Delphia##br#
 You hear footsteps approach the nest, and the two of you turn to see#br#
Delphia approaching. From the slump of her shoulders, you can tell#br#she was unsuccessful in her pursuit. "I lost her..." #M327090$Delphia$826$56$0$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
 Agatha's frown deepens, and she shakes her head.#br#
"Tch. This is gonna be fun then, isn't it?" #M320090$Agatha$4$$1$0#|
10710|Agatha tells you a bit about Lenora's somewhat questionable past, but as soon as Delphia comes back Lenora-less, the two of you decide the nature-loving pacifist needs to be found posthaste—there's an Eyedim Dragon lurking nearby, after all!

Though unsure where to search first, you decide it best begin your hunt for Little Miss Lenora in some of the locales the two of you frequented...|
10711|#&7$Agatha##br#
"You heard about the #&46$Eyedim Dragon#, didn't you, %n%? It's what we were all in#br#
 the middle of discussing when you and Lenora showed up. Seems a few civilians spotted#br#it not far from town. Blighted thing could really make a nuisance of itself, to put it mildly." #M320090$Agatha$4$$1$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"As the name implies, the thing is as blind as a bat, but to make up for its lack of sight,#br#
 it's got a crazy keen sense of smell. It's a big galuga, and so far its been surviving off#br#
 animal corpses, but if it runs out of easy prey..." Agatha's eyes darken.#br#
 "Well, you see why we need to do something about it."   #M320090$Agatha$821$$1$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
 She throws a quick glance over at Delphia, who's still visibly upset.#br#
"At any rate, Lenora's clearly emotionally unstable at the moment. Who knows#br# what she might try or where she might go. We need to find her before#br#
 something bad happens, especially with that dragon on the loose." #M320090$Agatha$4$$1$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
 You couldn't agree more. Nodding your head to show you'd be more than#br#
 happy to help, you wait for Agatha to finish talking with Delphia before#br#leaving to update Pelt on the situation. #M320090$Agatha$4$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 While you can't for the life of you imagine where Lenora might have run off to,#br#
 you decide your best bet is to start with the places you and Lenora visited before#br#she disappeared...#char$$301$$0$0#|
10712|#&7$Delphia##br#
"Poor Lenora. Van's acceptance means SO much to her.#br# I can only imagine how hard she must be taking this..."#M327090$Delphia$4$$1$0#|
10713|#&7$%n%##br#
 You hand over Feros's white piece of Dragocite to Delphia upon your return to#br#
 the Falcon's Nest before quickly filling her in on the whole story.#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Delphia##br#
 Delphia, seemingly mesmerized by the faint, white glow of the chunk of rock,#br# 
is quiet for a moment before meeting your gaze. "This is all... I never thought..."#M327090$Delphia$4$$1$0#

#&7$Delphia##br#
She shakes her head, freeing herself from her stupor.#br#
 "I cannot thank you enough, %n%. For everything, truly.#br#
 Without you, I don't know WHAT we would have done." #M327090$Delphia$822$51$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You respond with a bashful grin and shake your head—you were just#br#
 doing your job, after all. Anyone one of the other Falcons would have#br# done the same in your situation.#char$$821$$0$0#
  

#&7$Delphia##br#
"You know, %n%. It's truly a pity I didn't snatch you up when I had the chance!#br#
 Curse my lack of assertive foresight." She lets out an overdramatic sigh, eyes skyward. #M327090$Delphia$826$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 At this, you can't help but laugh. It feels good after everything that just happened.#char$$824$$0$0#|
10714|#&7$%n%##br#
 When you finally find Lenora, her eyes are red and puffy, and her cheeks#br# are streaked with tear lines. You can tell she's been crying.#char$$823$$0$0#

#&7$Lenora##br#
 She hears your approach and glances up in surprise.#br#
"%n%?! H-... how did you get here? Why did... how did...?" #M324091$Lenora$823$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You explain that you're actually here in search of HER, and the rest of the Falcons#br# probably would be, too, if they didn't have a prowling dragon on the loose to worry about.#char$$4$$0$0#
    

#&7$%n%##br#
 As you take a quick glance about the environs, you can't help the feeling of dread#br#
 that starts marbling in your stomach. Hadn't Agatha said that dragon was attracted#br#
 to the smell of animal corpses? And... there are certainly a lot of... animal corpses here...#char$$821$$0$0#

#&7$Lenora##br#
 Lenora's gaze, too, pans across the field of slain Ironfang Jackals.#br#
"These poor creatures... they died because of me.#br#
 I wanted to... do something for them. To help them rest in peace.#br# So I was going to bury them..." #M324091$Lenora$826$56$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Certainly the first time you've ever heard of a hunter wanting to provide#br#
 their prey a proper burial, but, coming from Lenora, this doesn't surprise#br#
 you in the least. You tell her you'd like to help, if she'd let you.#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Lenora##br#
"Oh... thank you, %n%. Of course! I would be... truly grateful..."#br#
 Lenora lets out a tiny sigh as her shoulders sag.#br#
"You are such a good person, %n%. As is everyone in the Falcons!#br#
 I-... I don't deserve your kindness... I don't deserve anything..."#M324091$Lenora$822$51$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Something tells you Lenora is thinking of leaving the Falcons.#br#
 You quickly pipe in that the other Falcons are all waiting for her!#br#
 They're worried and want her to come back.#char$$823$$0$0#

#&7$Lenora##br#
"But, I-... I let him down. I let Van down.#br#
 I don't have the right to go back. Not after... what I did...#br#
 Oh, %n%. What am I supposed to do? Where can I go?#br#
 Will he... will he ever forgive me?" Lenora's eyes fill with tears once more. #M324091$Lenora$826$56$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You find yourself at a loss, wanting to console the poor girl, but not quite sure how.#char$$1$$0$0#

#&7$Lenora##br#
"When... when I was a little girl, the other shamans never understood me.#br#
 For some reason, I was more attuned to the spiritual world than even many#br#
 of my tribe's elders. They... couldn't comprehend my connection with the Dragomon.#br#Especially the aggressive ones..." Lenora's face softens as she gazes off in the distance. #M324091$Lenora$821$$1$0#

#&7$Lenora##br#
"I'm the only one who knows... who realizes just what Dragomon are.#br#
 That they've been blessed by holy spirits and only harm others because#br#they know they'll die if they don't fight back." #M324091$Lenora$4$$1$0#

#&7$Lenora##br#
"No one would listen to me... no one would believe me. They thought me strange#br#
 and different. They distanced me from the other children so I wouldn't impart on them#br# my 'strange ways of thinking.' I was... very lonely as a child, you can imagine.#br#
 But then I met #&46$Feros#, and all that changed."  
   #M324091$Lenora$826$56$1$0#

#&7$Lenora##br#
"Feros was a young Eyedim Dragon that had been cast out from its people, just like#br#
 me. The other shamans thought him a monster, but I knew different! I knew he was#br#
 as gentle as a lamb and just as deserving of love. He was my... only friend."
   #M324091$Lenora$821$$1$0#

#&7$Lenora##br#
"But one day... one day the other shamans followed me when I left to meet with Feros.#br#
 They saw what was going on and demanded I tell them where Feros was living.#br#
 They tried to convince me he was an evil monster—that I should let them rid this world#br#
 of him before he attacked our village!" #M324091$Lenora$826$$1$0#

#&7$Lenora##br#
"Feros, he... I knew that he would never hurt a flea! He was my friend. My one, true friend.#br#
 I couldn't betray him. I-... I refused to tell them, but one night when I snuck out meet with#br#
 Feros again, they followed me. Followed me all the way to his cave..." #M324091$Lenora$821$$1$0#

#&7$Lenora##br#
"I tried to stop them! They attacked Feros—tried to cage him like a wild animal!#br#
 But I used a spell to distract them and he escaped. The shamans were outraged and#br#
 expelled me from the tribe. I've never seen them... or Feros... again."#M324091$Lenora$827$56$1$0#
  

#&7$%n%##br#
 You're unsure how to respond to Lenora's story. You can't come up with an appropriate#br#
 response for the tale you've just been told. It's too... too heartbreaking.#br#
 As you're standing in silence, however, the ground begins to rumble and#br#shake beneath your feet. You whip out your weapon. Something's coming!#char$$823$$0$0#|
10715|#&7$%n%##br#
 You rush over to Lenora, scanning her for any signs of injury.#br#
 Her face is pallid and clammy, and she's having a hard time standing.#char$$821$$0$0#

#&7$Lenora##br#
"I'm... I'm fine, really... I-... why? Why did... #&46$Feros# attack me?#br#
 We're... friends... We were each others' only friends..."#br#
 Lenora's eyes remain fixed in the direction Feros fled.
   #M324091$Lenora$826$56$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Giving her shoulder a little shake to snap her out of her trance, you try to#br#
 tell her #&46$Feros# isn't the Dragomon she once knew. He's different now!#br#
 Changed. And now you're all in danger because of him.#char$$4$$00#

#&7$Lenora##br#
 "You're... you're right, %n%. He has changed. He's not the same Feros I once knew..."#br#
Lenora shakily turns her head away, fighting back tears.#M324091$Lenora$821$$1$0#
  

#&7$Lenora##br#
 "I-... I know what I need to do, but I can't do it alone. Would you help me, %n%?"#br#
Her jaw is clenched as she turns back towards you, eyes imploring. #M324091$Lenora$822$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You give her a resolute nod and confidently thump your chest.#br#
 Of course, you will. Through thick and thin, right? Though you#br#
 do have just one question—what exactly is she going to do once she finds Feros?#char$$821$$0$0#

#&7$Lenora##br#
 Lenora simply shakes her head, eyes tight.#br#
"I don't... I don't know... I don't know yet...#br#
 I need some time to think about it..."#M324091$Lenora$826$56$1$0#|
10716|Search to the north of the Grizzlejaw habitat|
10717|Search to the south of the Grizzlejaw habitat|
10718|Investigate the ferocious noise!|
10719|Track the Eyedim Dragon|
10720|It's over. Done. Feros is dead by Lenora's own hand, and though it will take everyone involved a while to recover from the tragedy, a number of things were finally cleared up between Lenora and Pelt. You suppose if it had to end SOME way, it might as well have ended up like it did.

After you report in to Delphia back in the nest, she comments that Pelt and Lenora returned not too long ago. Perhaps you should see how Lenora is faring?|
10721|#&7$Delphia##br#
"I must say, though, I never would have expected that from Nash, yes?#br#
 He's never been one to think of anyone besides himself!"#br#
Delphia's hands go to her hips as she quietly chews on her lower lip. #M327090$Delphia$821$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You shrug, equally as flummoxed expression on your own#br#
 face as you respond that you're just as surprised.#char$$806$$0$0#

#&7$Delphia##br#
"That reminds me! I saw Van return with Lenora just a few moments ago.#br#
 Perhaps you'd like to check in on them for me? I've, unfortunately, been inundated#br#
 with a sudden influx of work and won't be able to step away for a bit longer." #M327090$Delphia$4$51$1$0#|
10722|#&7$Delphia##br#
"I'm sure seeing you would put a smile on Lenora's face."#br#   #M327090$Delphia$4$51$1$0#|
10723|#&7$%n%##br#
 You meander your way back to the nest to let Delphia know about#br#
 Lenora's recovery, making sure to mention Nash and the duck as well.#char$$821$$0$0#

#&7$Delphia##br#
"He did WHAT? Well, my, my! It seems everyone around here is going#br#
 through changes lately, yes? And all for the better!"#br# Delphia's inspiriting smile brings a grin to your own face. #M327090$Delphia$4$$1$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"Doo doo dooo... oh! Well, if it isn't Delphia! Looking mighty fine today, if I might add.#br#
 Was just getting the hankerin' for some tea. Say, you wouldn't happen to have that same#br#hankerin', too, would ya? Wouldn't THAT be a coincidence, eh? EH?" Pelt waltzes#br#his way over with a cheery hum. #M330090$Van Pelt$821$51$0$0#

#&7$Delphia##br#
"Alas, I think you're on your own with that one, Van.#br#
 No tea hankerings here!" Delphia's smile widens, but you#br# still catch the underlying sadistic twinkle in her eyes. #M327090$Delphia$821$51$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You're suddenly taken back to your very first day here in the Falcon's Nest.#br#
 Van Pelt had been cruelly rejected that day, too. It almost makes you a bit #br#
 nostalgic—you can barely imagine your life without the Falcons, now.#char$$1$$0$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"Well, sh—... oh! %n%! Didn't even see you there, squirt!#br#
 No harm, though. Actually had something I wanted to talk to you about!#br# Perfect timing, am I right?" Pelt gives you a prodding elbow to the gut.
   #M330090$Van Pelt$4$$1$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
All of a sudden, his hands begin roving his armor as if searching for #br#something.
 "Now, where did I... here? No... HERE? Oh, come on! I just had it like#br#
 five seconds ago, I swear!" He slips his hand into what you can only#br#
 assume is a chest pocket. "AHA! Here we are..." #M330090$Van Pelt$823$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You're just beginning to wonder if you should avert your eyes when Pelt finally#br#
 procures what he'd been looking for. Your eyes widen as they take in the sight.#br#It couldn't be, could it? A... a #&46$captain's badge#?!#char$$823$$0$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"You did good out there, kid. No... you did MORE than good. You did great!#br#
 You not only helped Lenora, but you took out that dragon as well. I couldn't call#br#
 myself the leader of the Falcons if I didn't recognize that kinda talent! I had a long#br#chat with Bain, and we both agree... you deserve a promotion." #M330090$Van Pelt$4$51$1$0#

#&7$Delphia##br#
"Long chat? As far as I can remember, it didn't last more than a moment or two.#br#
 What lasted until the break of dawn was the two of you drinking, making a ruckus,#br# and generally hanging all over each other like immature, giggly frat boys.#br#
 Poor Agatha and I spent ALL morning cleaning up the mess..."
   #M327090$Delphia$821$51$0$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"I-... I don't know what you're talking about!#br#
 Oh, look at the time! I have a very, VERY important appointment#br# with dearest Gartholomew, so you'll, uh, have to excuse me! Tootles!"#br#
 Pelt's face goes as white as a sheet, and he gallops away like a spooked stallion. #M330090$Van Pelt$301$53$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You hesitantly glance over at Delphia. Her smile itself hasn't changed, but her eyes#br#
 exude a sort of unbridled malice you wouldn't wish on your worst enemy. You start#br#to wish Pelt had taken you with him...#char$$1$$1$0#

#&7$Delphia##br#
"Hmm... well, for Lenora's sake, I'll pardon him. THIS time..."#br#
 She turns towards you, and you instinctively wince, but her expression seems#br#
devoid of its earlier murderous intentions. "At any rate, %n%—congratulations#br#
 on your promotion! I've never seen someone rise through the ranks so quickly."   #M327090$Delphia$4$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You sheepishly toe a loose stone on the ground and thank her for the kind words.#char$$807$$1$0#

#&7$Delphia##br#
"As humble as always, I see. Van isn't the only person who never changes!#br# Keep up the good work, %n%. You're truly an inspiration to us all." #M327090$Delphia$4$51$0$0#|
10724|#&7$Lenora##br#
"Oh, %n%! It's you! I... just wanted to thank you again. For everything..."#br#
 Lenora's face melts into a warm smile upon your approach. #M324090$Lenora$822$51$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Glad to see she's doing all right after the incident, you shoot her a smile of your own.#char$$801$$0$0#

#&7$Lenora##br#
"I've... decided to stay, %n%. Van and I, we... had a long talk, and I#br#
 feel much better about everything, now. I may not be able to hunt like the#br#
 rest of you, but I can help other Dragomon like Feros and keep a tragedy#br#like this from ever happening again." #M324090$Lenora$821$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Lenora's words couldn't have made you happier. She'll stay? Unable to contain#br#
 your emotions, you step forward and pull her into a giant bear hug.#char$$803$$0$0#

#&7$Nash##br#
"I'm not, erm... interrupting anything, am I?"#br#
 You turn around with a start to see Nash standing behind you. #M322090$Nash$1$$0$0#

#&7$Lenora##br#
"Oh! Nash! And... who is this little darling with you?"#br#
 Lenora glances down at the shy Quackadactyl hiding behind Nash's legs. #M324090$Lenora$823$$1$0#

#&7$Nash##br#
 "He, erm, well... I brought him back from the forest that day! I thought I'd try#br#
and help him recover, you know... like a... a good Samaritan!"#br#
 Nash blinks owlishly, for once, not quite knowing what to say. #M322090$Nash$4$$0$0#

#&7$Nash##br#
"He made his first step again today, so I thought I'd bring him here to see you..."#br#
 Squatting down, Nash urges the tiny duckling forward with a gentle pat of his hand. #M322090$Nash$4$51$0$0#

#&7$Lenora##br#
"Oh, thank you, Nash! Thank you! This makes me so happy!"#br#
 Lenora takes the Quackadactyl into her arms with a smile the size of a Rhinosker. #M324090$Lenora$822$51$1$0#

#&7$Lenora##br#
Cuddling the duckling against her cheek, she turns towards both of you.#br#
 "Thank you... both of you! What you've done means the world to me.#br#
 I promise to try harder and get more involved with the rest of the order.#br#
 I don't want anyone to worry about me anymore!" #M324090$Lenora$821$51$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 The sight makes you beam with pride, and you shoot her an energetic thumbs-up.#br#
 Glancing over at Nash, however, you spy him throwing you a dirty look.#char$$806$$0$0#

#&7$Nash##br#
"...I-... I did more than %n%..."#br#
 He brings a melodramatic hand to his forehead before sighing#br#with a shrug. "Meh. Three's company, right?" #M322090$Nash$826$$1$0#|
10730|Angel's found someone to extract silk from those pupae, but as processing silk isn't exactly like wandering down to Thelma Lou's and getting an orange soda pop, you'll have a bit of free time on your hands while you wait. You're just going to have to wait.

With a shrug, you trudge off to find some Hunters' League Assignments to do in your spare time.|
10731|#&7$Angel##br#
"Jiminy Christmas—I'm sorry, %n%! I feel like all I ever do is make you run#br#
 around doing this and that for Doreen. You probably hate coming to talk to me...#M308060$Angel$822$$1$0#

#&7$Doreen##br#
"Well, if you weren't such a boring dullard always up to his ears in work I wouldn't#br# HAVE to now, would I, my dear Angel?" Doreen pokes her head out from the#br#
 side door as if her ears are specifically wired to pick up on the sound of your footsteps. #M815010s100+30$Doreen$825$$0$0#

#&7$Angel##br#
"All right! All right! All right! I admit I've been... a bit weighed down lately."#br#
 Angel shoots her an appeasing smile in hopes of assuaging her chagrin. #M308060$Angel$4$$1$0#

#&7$Angel##br#
"Ah, by the way! Got somethin' to tell you."#br#
 Angel turns back around before you can even#br#think about potentially fleeing the scene.#char$$1$$0$0#

#&7$Angel##br#
"I found someone to extract silk from those pupae you brought me!#br#
 What'd I tell you, huh? Just leave it to old Angel!" #M308060$Angel$821$$1$0#

#&7$Angel##br#
"Of course, it'll TAKE a little while... I mean, you did bring back a LOT of#br#
 pupae, and processing silk is a complicated process...#br#
 Why not take a few assignments while you're waiting, whaddaya say?" #M308060$Angel$4$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Internally rolling your eyes, you tell him you'd be happy to take on a few assignments. #char$$806$$0$0#

#&7$Angel##br#
"Ah, excellent. You're as reliable as ever!#br#
 Can you go check in with #&46$Joanna# to see what she needs?#br#
 I know she has a lot of assignments that she could use some help on." #M308060$Angel$824$$1$0#|
10732|#&7$Angel##br#
"God almighty, we're never gonna get all these assignments taken care of..."#br#
 Angel runs a hand through his hair, clearly exasperated. #M308060$Angel$826$$1$0#|
10733|#&7$%n%##br#
 You walk up to see Angel surrounded by a throng of impatient people#br# It seems like he's as occupied as ever.#char$$1$$0$0#

#&7$Doreen##br#
"Oooh! You're back! Yippee!"#br#
 Doreen notices you and immediately bounds over with a hop, a skip, and a jump. #M815010s100+30$Doreen$821$$1$0#

#&7$Doreen##br#
"Are you all done with your assignments yet? Huh? Are you?"#br#
 You don't even have to wonder why she's suddenly so interested#br#in your current state of work... #M815010s100+30$Doreen$831$$1$0#|
10740|Despite Agatha's insistence that you keep from slacking, it's hard NOT to slack when there are no new assignments to take!

Delphia suggests you see if Angel's come up with anything over in the Hunters' League. If you know him, he's BOUND to have an assignment or two.|
10741|#&7$Delphia##br#
"If you're looking for Agatha, dear, she had a few important#br#
 errands to attend to. She did, however, leave you a note!" #M327090$Delphia$821$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You carefully open the letter, thoughts racing as you imagine what she could have written.#br#
      "Hey, rook! If you even think of slacking off, I'll have Louis dump cockroaches#br#
      in your bed tonight, you got it? Have a wonderful day! —Agatha"#br#
 Delightful as always. You fold the note back up without another word.#char$$823$$0$0#

#&7$Delphia##br#
"Ohh... that's so sweet! Agatha really does care for you, dear." #M327090$Delphia$4$51$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Delphia and you seem to harbor conflicting definitions of the word "sweet."#br#
 You slide the note into your pocket with a sigh. You really shouldn't have#br#expected anything else—this is Agatha you're talking about!#char$$821$$0$0#

#&7$Delphia##br#
"She can see all that caged-up potential just waiting to get out!#br#
 She only wants the best for you, after all. Try not to let her down!" #M327090$Delphia$821$51$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You nod in affirmation. That cockroach threat was enough to keep you on#br#
 your toes for WEEKS! Wanting to start off your day on the right foot, you ask Delphia#br#if—perchance—any new assignments had come in that you could have a go at.#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Delphia##br#
"Let me think..." Delphia taps a finger against her lips. "Actually, we don't have#br#
 much of anything right now! The #&46$Hunters' League#, though, usually has an#br#
 assignment or two, so you might try there. Angel is always happy to see you, after all." #M327090$Delphia$4$$1$0#|
10742|#&7$Delphia##br#
"As we don't have any new assignments at the moment, I recommend you#br#
 check in with #&46$Chairman Angel in the Hunters' League#. He may have something!#br#
 You could also use this opportunity to find #&46$Craftsman Harris# and improve your gear.#br#
 I believe either of those paths would keep you safe  from obvious 'slackage?'" #M327090$Delphia$821$$1$0#|
10743|#&7$%n%##br#
 You're on your way back to see Delphia and check if there aren't any new assignments#br#
 you could take off her hands when you notice the bustling crowd gathered in the#br#
 Falcon's nest. Curious, you push through them until you reach your pink-haired colleague.#char$$823$$0$0#

#&7$Delphia##br#
"Oh, %n%! Thank the maker, it's you! It's like the heavens have opened up above#br#
 me and set forth a raging deluge of assignments! I simply can't keep up with them!#br#
 You'd help me, wouldn't you?" Her soft brown eyes fill up with tears.#br#
 How can you say no to THAT?! #M327090$Delphia$821$$1$0#|
10744|#&7$Van Pelt##br#
 A few more assignments under your belt—and pockets just a bit more full—you're#br#
 heading back to the Falcon's Nest to report on your progress when Van Pelt calls you over. #M330090$Van Pelt$2$$1$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"%n%! Long time no see! I feel like it's been since... since... yesterday!#br#
 You know me, though. I'm a people person! Gotta be about my favorite people#br#
 or I become systematically more and more depressed. Anyway, enough about me—how's#br#
 your training coming along? You're looking pretty built!" #M330090$Van Pelt$821$$1$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"You haven't, by chance, heard about one of our order's most coveted titles,#br#
 have you? That's right! I'm talking about the title of #&46$Dragoon Cavalier#.#br#
 One of our most prestigious ranks! Everyone wants in on a bit of the cavalier action,#br#
 but only a few can achieve it. Keep it up, and that title may one day be yours." #M330090$Van Pelt$4$$1$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"At the moment, only a few of our finest elite currently hold the title. Maybe you've met#br#
 a few of them? One in particular is a bit of a strange duck, but he gets the job done,#br#
 and that's what counts. Ever since I saw you, though, well... I've thought if anyone#br#
 could nab that title, it was you! So... don't let me down! Or else!" Pelt bursts into jovial laughter.   #M330090$Van Pelt$824$51$1$0#|
10750|Shucks! The silk still isn't ready yet!

You suppose you're going to need to learn a bit more patience, but until then, you'll just have to make do with some Hunters' League Assignments from Clerk Joanna.|
10751|#&7$Angel##br#
 You glance over towards Angel and notice that the crowd has started to disperse.#br#
 Angel dusts off his hands, unbuttons the collar of his shirt with a wince, then#br#
turns in your direction. "Sorry to keep you waiting, %n%. You know, Hunters'#br#
 League business and all that... It's tough being the guy in charge!" #M308060$Angel$822$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You wave off his apology with a knowing shrug before asking him how the silk is coming along.#char$$821$$0$0#

#&7$Angel##br#
 "The silk! Yes, yes, the silk..." He gazes off in the distance for a moment, then hurriedly#br#
begins rifling through the papers on his desk. "Aha! Here we are. Yes, silk, silk...#br#
 It says right here that it will still take some time. Mm-hm! It also says the best way#br#
 to make the time go faster is by completing a few assignments! Huh! Well, I'll be!" #M308060$Angel$4$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You nod to show that you understand and ask him if he needs any help.#char$$806$$0$0#

#&7$Angel##br#
"How kind of you to ask!#br#
 Nothing major, but could you try to go find #&46$Joanna# again?" #M308060$Angel$821$51$1$0#|
10752|#&7$Angel##br#
"We have so many assignments...it's getting to be a real headache."#br#
 Angel scratches his head, looking drained. #M308060$Angel$826$$1$0#|
10753|#&7$Angel##br#
"Thank you kindly! I must say, you are a great help. #br#
 Without you, I really think I would be buried up to my neck in all these#br#
 assignments. Doreen would need a shovel to dig me out, haha!" #M308060$Angel$4$51$1$0#|
10760|Angel and Doreen certainly make a strange pair, but despite the bickering and the name calling and the exasperation, you can tell they wouldn't have it any other way!

The silk is almost ready. While you wait, Angel suggests you take a few quests from the Hunters' League.|
10761|#&7$Angel##br#
"Aw geez, %n%. I have to apologize! Doreen put you to work again, didn't she?"#br#
 Angel shoots Doreen an exasperated (but knowing) look. #M308060$Angel$822$$1$0#

#&7$Doreen##br#
"But Angel, deeeeeear! You've barely even SPOKEN to me the last couple of days!#br#
 Why, sometimes I think you like your work more than you like me!" Doreen crosses#br#her arms over her chest and turns away with a disgruntled pout. #M815010s100+30$Doreen$825$$0$0#

#&7$Angel##br#
"Doreeeeen! You know that's not true! Come on, don't be like that!#br#
 Listen, how about this—you come help me out with these laaaast couple#br# things I need to do, and I'll put everything else off 'till tomorrow so we can#br#have a night out on the town. How does that sound?" #M308060$Angel$821$$1$0#

#&7$Doreen##br#
"Really? It moved? Doreen's eyes widen in burgeoning hope. #M815010s100+30$Doreen$831$$0$0#

#&7$Angel##br#
"HA! Would I lie? How could I do that to my best girl, huh?"#br# Angel shoots her an energetic thumbs-up. #M308060$Angel$4$$1$0#

#&7$Doreen##br#
"Oh, Angel! I'm so happy! Of course, I'll help you! Right away!#br#
 We'll get the rest of your work in two shakes of a bunny derrière!"#br#
 Doreen leaps towards Angel with a flourish, brilliant tears littering#br#the air behind her. #M815010s100+30$Doreen$821$$0$0#

#&7$Angel##br#
"Yeah, yeah, what would you do without your Angel, huh?"#br#
 Angel gives Doreen's ears a thorough skritching as she continues#br#to weep in overemotional elation. #M308060$Angel$821$51$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 The sight makes you smile. Then, it makes you laugh.#br#Pretty soon, you have tears in your eyes yourself.#char$$806$$0$0#

#&7$Angel##br#
"By the way, %n%.#br#
 As you've nearly finished with your assignment, would you mind helping out by#br#
 handling a few quests for me? I'd really appreciate it with all the work piling up." #M308060$Angel$4$$1$0#|
10762|#&7$Angel##br#
"We're almost through. Then we can finally call it a day!" #M308060$Angel$4$$1$0#|
10763|#&7$%n%##br#
 There are a few people waiting to speak with Angel. He looks extremely busy. #char$$1$$0$0#

#&7$Doreen##br#
"Oh, %n%! Yoohoo! I'm afraid dear Angel is a mite bit busy, now!#br#
 You'll have to wait a few minutes, is that alright?"
 She shakes her ears, and they flop about with identical bounces. #M815010s100+30$Doreen$831$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You give her head a tiny pat and respond that you can wait—it's not incredibly urgent.#char$$821$$0$0#|

10785|Go to the Dawnrise Stream with Scully|
10790|According to Angel, traces of the <Granite Gorehorn> Torrkus have recently been discovered in the Prison of Ancients.

Find yourself a worthy party and take that bloodthirsty bull down!|
10791|#&7$Angel##br#
"%n%, you did a real number on that last hunt I sent you out on, eh?#br#
 Well, guess what? We've got another hunt that needs strong volunteers!#br#
 So, what do you say? Interested?" #M308060$Angel$4$$1$0#

#&7$Angel##br#
"Seems like traces of that big brute, #&46$<Granite Gorehorn> Torrkus#, have been#br#
 popping up all over the Prison of Ancients. Real nasty critter. Likes to gore people.#br#
 You can imagine it's not pretty. Anyway, hunters by the dozen have started forming#br#posses in an attempt to give that bull a run for its money." #M308060$Angel$1$$1$0#

#&7$Angel##br#
"If you plan on joining the fray, so to speak, I'd highly recommend#br#
 finding yourself a party first. This bad boy's not gonna go down easily.#br#
 You'll want a few friends on your side when the going gets tough." #M308060$Angel$821$$1$0#|
10792|#&7$Angel##br#
"Remember our motto here in the Hunter's League—safety first!#br#
 Actually, I just made that up right now, but it's only because I wanna make#br#
 sure you're not careless! Never go into a hunt unprepared." #M308060$Angel$821$$1$0#

#&7$Angel##br#
"If you're still in need of a posse to help tame the beast,#br#
 try hanging around the bulletin boards. There's usually at least#br#
 a few other hunters there on the lookout for a party to join." #M308060$Angel$4$$1$0#|
10793|#&7$%n%##br#
 You hand Angel the Dragocite you obtained from Torrkus's corpse.#br#
 He accepts it with an impressed whistle.#char$$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Angel##br#
"You did good work out there, %n%.#br#
 At the rate you're improving, you'll be a hunter#br#
 worth writing home about in no time!"#br# #M308060$Angel$4$$1$0#|
10800|According to Angel, the lost <Armordillo> Broot has recently been sighted in Hallowshroud Tree.

Find yourself a worthy party and take that dangerous dillo down!|
10801|#&7$Angel##br#
"Ah, %n%! Get your up-and-coming little self over here, kid!#br#
 We just got a new assignment in, and boy is it a doozy! Think you're up for it?" #M308060$Angel$821$$1$0#

#&7$Angel##br#
"Seem ol' #&46$<Armordillo> Broot# has appeared in Hallowshroud Tree.#br#
 You know how these things go. A bounty's been put on his head, and rooks#br#
 and vets alike are all clambering to get in on the action." #M308060$Angel$4$$1$0#

#&7$Angel##br#
"Of course, all of the above just make him an even juicier target for your average,#br#
 gung-ho hunter, esPECially with that piece of rare Dragocite he's said to be carrying.#br#
 Thing's probably worth a fortune! Just... don't rush out unprepared! Unless you#br#fancy losing a limb..." #M308060$Angel$821$$1$0#|
10802|#&7$Angel##br#
"Remember our motto here in the Hunter's League—safety first!#br#
 Actually, I just made that up right now, but it's only because I wanna make#br#
 sure you're not careless! Never go into a hunt unprepared." #M308060$Angel$821$$1$0#

#&7$Angel##br#
"If you're still in need of a posse to help tame the beast,#br#
 try hanging around the bulletin boards. There's usually at least#br#
 a few other hunters there on the lookout for a party to join." #M308060$Angel$4$$1$0#|
10803|#&7$%n%##br#
 You hand Angel the Dragocite you recovered from Broot's corpse.#br#
 He accepts the gem and smiles proudly.#char$$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Angel##br#
"Ha! You did better than I could've hoped for, kid!#br#
 Keep up the sterling work and you'll be shooting up the ranks in no time!"
   #M308060$Angel$821$$1$0#|
10810|Delphia mentions to Van Pelt that assignments seem to be coming in like sunlight in a glass house. She also comments on how many poor souls have been injured while trying to complete them. Van Pelt, understandably, tells everyone to be careful and not to let their guard down, even if the quests seem like a walk in the park.

Before you walk away, Delphia ALSO mentions a new assignment Agatha's been wanting to give you. Better see what it entails, ASAP!

|
10811|#&7$Delphia##br#
"You're like an angel, dear! Thank you so much!#br#
 I was about ready to SCREAM!" #M327090$Delphia$4$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You're reminded of Delphia's reaction to Van Pelt's womanizing and money-squandering#br#
 and quickly decide then and there that you'll never let her get to that point again#br#on YOUR watch.#char$$821$$0$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"Some kinda party goin' on around here? This is more people than#br#
 I've seen in the nest since the Falcon Christmas Party!"#br#
 Van Pelt comes sauntering over with an amused grin. He doesn't#br#
 seem at all worried about Delphia's frazzled appearance. #M330090$Van Pelt$351$$1$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"What's the news? What's the buzz? What's the hey-dally-hey?#br#
 As leader of this order, I need to be informed of all extra-curricular#br#
 activities, you know!" Pelt glances around before frowning in obvious#br#disappointment. "I see no punch bowl." #M330090$Van Pelt$4$$1$0#

#&7$Delphia##br#
"Van, it's insane! We've got requests coming in left and right! I can scarcely#br#
 get new hunters on them fast enough! We've already got a queue going#br#
 for even the most menial of tasks." Delphia glances down at her ledger,#br#
 the paper itself trailing off the edge of her clipboard. #M327090$Delphia$822$$0$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"Why the frowny face? That just means business is booming!#br#
 People are finally giving us the recognition we so rightfully deserve!"#br#
 Pelt's fists go to his hips, and he gazes off into the sun as though#br#basking in the accomplishments of his colleagues. #M330090$Van Pelt$824$51$1$0#

#&7$Delphia##br#
"But VAN. It's not ALL good news. There's been an increase in the number#br#
 of injuries, too! Again, for even the simplest tasks! I don't know how many#br#
 hunters I've sent out on routine assignments, now, only to see them come back#br#
 looking entirely worse for the wear. I think all this work is taking its toll on them."
   #M327090$Delphia$826$56$0$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"Easy enough to fix! Clearly these hunters just aren't taking their work#br#
 seriously! Give 'em a day or two to recover, then send 'em back to the#br#
 training grounds for some mop duty. That'll fix 'em up!"#br#Pelt nods his head as if agreeing with himself. #M330090$Van Pelt$821$$1$0#

#&7$Delphia##br#
"Vaaaan!" Delphia's eyes grow worryingly narrow. "It's not just our#br#
 rookies that have been coming back with these injuries. Even some of our#br#
 most experienced hunters have fared similar fates." At Delphia's mushrooming#br#
 disapproval, Pelt's brows finally start to furrow. #M327090$Delphia$4$$0$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"Well! Um, we should definitely tell them to be more on their guard, then, yes? After all,#br# the safety of our hunters is paramount! We can't have them running off and constantly#br#
 injuring themselves. Think of the press, ahaha... ha... Anyway! If you'll excuse me,#br#
 I'm needed in a meeting across town." With a nod of his head, he slowly walks off.  
   #M330090$Van Pelt$4$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You don't miss his slight change in mood as you watch his retreating form.#br#
 Despite his best efforts, you can tell he's worried, too. REALLY worried.#char$$1$$0$0#

#&7$Delphia##br#
"Oh, Van..." Delphia sighs, gazing after him a moment before turning her attention#br#
 back to you. "Ah, right! %n%, you wouldn't be able to help me with this assignment#br# that just came in, would you? I've already given the details to Agatha, so if you#br#
 find her, she'll fill you in on the specifics."
   #M327090$Delphia$4$$1$0#|
10812|...|
10813|#&7$Agatha##br#
"%n%, THERE you are! I thought I was gonna have to take out my#br#
 conch and summon you here myself! I'm sure you're aware of the#br#
 barrage of assignments we've been hit with, yes?" #M320090$Agatha$4$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You nod, mentioning Delphia and Van Pelt's earlier conversation.#br#
 You make sure to include the part about all the hunters coming back#br#with perplexing injuries.#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"Well, you get what you pay for, after all. We don't have enough bodies for the job!#br# Which is exactly why I need you to handle this assignment, yeah? So listen up!"#br#
 Agatha pokes the middle of your chest, a sly smile playing on her lips.
   #M320090$Agatha$824$51$1$0#|
10820|The order's most recent assignment involves collecting Beakis Eggs for some nobleman's grand banquet. Agatha assures you it should be a cake walk—Beakises are docile creatures, after all—so you head off with your spirits high and an unbridled confidence surging through your belly.

Time to get your egg on! To the Ventari Fields!|
10821|#&7$Agatha##br#
"Some snooty-tooty nobleman came to us with a request for eggs.#br#
 No, no... not the kind of eggs you can just run down to the store and buy#br#
 a dozen of. #&46$BEAKIS Eggs#! Seems he's putting on some kind of grand gala and#br#those are to be the main course." #M320090$Agatha$4$$1$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"Thankfully for us, Beakises are about as violent as Pelt is witty.#br#
 Seems like an open and shut job! You shouldn't have any troubles.#br#
 Just... don't forget what Van Pelt said. Keep your eyes peeled just in case." #M320090$Agatha$821$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You assure Agatha that she need not worry. You'll have#br# those eggs faster than the Beakises can lay 'em!#char$$4$$0$0#|
10822|#&7$Agatha##br#
"You'll find Beakises all over the Ventari Fields.#br#
 Kinda their roam away from roam, if you get my drift.#br#
 This assignment should be a piece of cake, but with all the weird things#br#happening around here lately, I'd keep your eyes peeled." #M320090$Agatha$821$$1$0#|
10823|#&7$Delphia##br#
"Oh, %n%! Welcome back! How did your assignment go?#br#
 Where's... the egg?" Delphia takes one look at your exasperated face#br#
 and can tell that things didn't go exactly as planned.
   #M327090$Delphia$4$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 With a shake of your head, you relay the events that transpired in the fields.#char$$821$$0$0#

#&7$Nobleman##br#
"Harumph! Excuses, excuses! Nothing but excuses!#br# You can't deny it! It was a simple task and you utterly and completely failed at it!#br#
 Feh, I suppose the Order of the Falcon's reputation for skill has been overstated!"#br#
 An irate gentleman walks over from the throng of civilians, stomping his foot.
   #M401060$Nobleman$825$55$1$0#

#&7$Delphia##br#
"My apologies, good sir. If you would kindly wait just a little longer,#br# we'll send another group to bring back your egg. It won't take long,#br#
 I can assure you!" Delphia's soothing voice can normally cool even the most#br#
 savage of beast, but it seems to have no effect against this red-faced patrician. #M327090$Delphia$4$$0$0#

#&7$Nobleman##br#
"Forget it! Just forget the whole thing! I won't have it, I simply WON'T! If I wait for#br# you to foul up even this SIMPLE task again, my glorious feast will be utterly ruined!#br#
 If I knew I was paying for failure, I'd have hired a gang of monkeys! Obviously, there's#br#
 no difference!" You can practically see the steam whistling from the man's ears.
   #M401060$Nobleman$4$55$1$0#

#&7$Nobleman##br#
"It seems that rumor that the lot of you are nothing but overweening, ham-spewing#br#
 gadabouts is true! And I'll be SURE to tell everyone else. Wouldn't want to let some#br#
 other poor soul suffer the same indignity I have! Harumph!"#br# The man turns on his heels without another word, walking away in an angry fit.
   #M401060$Nobleman$825$55$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You're a bit unsure whether to laugh or cry at what just transpired.#br#
 In the end, you simply stand motionless next to Delphia, a heavy-set#br#shame sweeping across your entire person.#char$$826$$0$0#|
10824|Collect a Beakis Egg|
10825|Carry the Beakis Egg to safety|
10830|A new customer—and a sanctimonious one, as well—has come to the Falcons with a request: collect scale powder from a Faefly... and FAST! She's so anxious to get her mitts on that purified powder that she plans to wait right there in the Falcon's Nest until someone brings it back for her.

Both you and Agatha think this vilifying vixen has something up her sleeve, so while you're out pilfering that powder, Agatha plans on keeping a watch on Little Miss Highbrow...|
10831|#&7$Delphia##br#
"Oh, %n%... Don't let people like that get to you, hm? He was very rude! Even#br#
 the most simple of quests have their setbacks from time to time. We've simply got to#br#
 learn to accept our mistakes and move on. Consider them a learning experience!"#br# Despite Delphia's warm smile, you can tell the man's tirade rattled her, as well.
   #M327090$Delphia$4$$1$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"Not sure how much of a learning experience it'll be if someone else#br#
 had their sticky hands in things..." Agatha chews on the inside of her cheek,#br#
 eyes narrowed as she watches the nobleman continue his walk of disgrace.
   #M320090$Agatha$821$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You're just about to ask her what exactly she means by this when a woman, clad in#br#
 fabulously luxurious attire, strolls straight past the line of civilians and cuts you off.#char$$821$$0$0#

#&7$Noblewoman##br#
"I wish to speak with the leader of the Order of the Falcons!"#br#
 Judging by her elegant poise, you can tell this lady is of noble birth. #M332020$Noblewoman$351$$1$0#

#&7$Noblewoman##br#
"I have a matter most urgent that needs attending to!#br#
 I demand to speak with the person in charge immediately!"#br#
 Her holier-than-thou attitude rubs you the wrong way, but Delphia#br#simply bows gracefully and responds with a smile. #M332020$Noblewoman$822$$1$0#

#&7$Delphia##br#
"Good day, madame. I'm afraid our leader is out on errand at the moment,#br# but I would be more than happy to hear the details of your request.#br#
 How might we help you today?"#br#
 Delphia's tact awes you more with each passing day.
   #M327090$Delphia$822$51$0$0#

#&7$Noblewoman##br#
"Hmph. I suppose you'll do. Just so long as it gets done! I have a desperate need for#br#
 #&46$Faefly scale powder#! Surely, the great Falcons should have no troubling#br#
 procuring this, yes? I plan to pay in coin upon delivery." #M332020$Noblewoman$821$$1$0#

#&7$Noblewoman##br#
"I need this done posthaste! I don't plan on leaving this spot until the powder#br#
 has been successfully retrieved. Can I have your full cooperation on this?"#br#
 The lady's full attention is on Delphia. It's as if you and Agatha don't even exist.
   #M332020$Noblewoman$4$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Judging by her magnificent clothes and eloquent speech, you guess that this woman is #br#
 probably a noble, as well. A mental image of the previous client bubbles to the top of#br#your memories, and you can't help but recall how similar this whole situation seems...#char$$1$$0$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"Well, ma'am! You couldn't have come at a better time! Our most prized hunter %n%,#br#
 here, will handle your task with the grace, tact, and efficiency of a spotted gazelle!"#br#
All of a sudden, Agatha leans towards you to whisper fiercely in your ear. "Something tells#br#
 me there's more to this broad than meets the eye. I'll stay here and keep an eye on her..." #M320090$Agatha$821$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You couldn't agree more. You nod hesitantly, then shake your head and nod again, this#br#
 time with the confidence of twenty armed men. You are %n%, the spotted gazelle!#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Delphia##br#
"Oh, wonderful! %n% will do a fine job, I'm sure! Your scale powder will be here#br#
 in two shakes of a gazelle's horns, ma'am! So please make yourself at home." Delphia#br#
 tosses a knowing smile in your direction before leading the woman away from the crowd.
  
   #M327090$Delphia$822$51$1$0#|
10832|#&7$Agatha##br#
"This lady is DEFinitely up to something, but I just don't know WHAT.#br#
 You head to the fields and get the the powder while I keep a watch on her..." #M320090$Agatha$821$$1$0#|
10833|#&7$%n%##br#
 You're on your way back to Agatha to report your lackluster results collecting the#br#
 scale powder when your ears pick up on a commotion in the Falcon's Nest.#char$$823$$0$0#

#&7$Noblewoman##br#
"Is this what passes for customer service around here? How dare you#br#
 treat a client so rudely?! I will not be talked to like this! I WON'T!"#br#
 It's the noblewoman from before, and she sounds as mad as a hatter. #M332020$Noblewoman$825$55$1$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"Look, I'm sorry if I somehow offended your entitled sensibilities, but I really don't get#br#
 what the big deal is. All I wanna know is what you want the scale powder for!#br#
 It's a legitimate question! The more we know about your request, the better we can provide#br#
 service, after all." You can tell Agatha's barely keeping it together. #M320090$Agatha$821$$0$0#

#&7$Noblewoman##br#
"Harumph! You know what? Forget the powder! Forget everything! I will not#br# stand here and be interrogated like... like... some CRIMINAL! I feel humiliated!#br#
 Humiliated and exposed and... and... deFROCKED! You can kiss your money goodbye!"#br#
 The noblewoman turns and storms out of the Falcon's Nest in a huff.
   #M332020$Noblewoman$2$55$1$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"Hmph. She's definitely hiding something. Did you see that? What a fussbudget!"#br#
 Agatha glowers in the direction the uppity upper cruster had just fled, her foot#br#
 tapping incessantly on the cobblestone. #M320090$Agatha$1$$0$0#

#&7$Delphia##br#
"Another botched assignment? Oh, dear... the sun isn't shining on the Falcons#br#
 today, it would seem" Delphia shakes her head sadly as she walks over. #M327090$Delphia$826$56$1$0#|
10834|Inspect the listless Faefly.|
10835|Inspect the listless Faefly.|
10836|Inspect the nearby Faeflies.|
10837|Inspect the listless Faefly again.|
10840|Agatha is determined to find out just who's behind this series of seemingly unreasonable requests, so she decides to tail the irate noblewoman who'd left the nest in a huff. Just as you and Delphia are gathering your bearings, you're approached by another hysterical woman—this one in tears! It seems her son has gone missing in the Ventari Fields.

Hurry to the nearest gearcopter! The longer you wait, the further that child could roam!|
10841|#&7$%n%##br#
 Once things have quieted down, you let Delphia and Agatha know about the Faefly situation.#br#
 It'd seemed like the poor things had already been sucked dry of every last ounce of powder!#char$$821$$0$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"Just as I expected. I knew there'd be no powder! This was all one big setup!#br#
 What I wanna know, though, is why? Also who! Oh, and where. I-I-I mean, c'mon!#br#
 This is getting ridiculous!" Agatha's eyes cloud as she continues to stare off in the#br#
 direction of the departed noblewoman. #M320090$Agatha$4$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Hearing that from Agatha makes you feel a little better about yourself—you DID#br#
 feel like a bit of a failure after those last two quests—but at the same time, you can't#br#
 help but worry about this gradually magnifying situation.#char$$1$$0$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"Clearly, I'm just gonna have to take matters into my own hands here.#br# I'll track down that witch and find out who sent her! Who she works for!#br#
 Maybe we can discover the source of these delightful 'clients' we keep getting..."#br#
 Agatha punches her palm, strangely salacious smile crossing her lips. #M320090$Agatha$4$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You can tell already that trying to rein her in would be just about as#br#
 successful as taming Pelt's libido. You wish her godspeed with a crisp salute.#char$$821$$0$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"Stop patronizing me! It's unbecoming. Oh, and Delphia—try to be a little more discerning,#br# would you? Don't just take every request that hobbles its way into our door!#br#
 I have a feeling we'll be getting a LOT more of these..." Agatha starts towards the#br#
 exit with a flip of her hair. "I'll contact you as soon as I find something."
  
   #M320090$Agatha$351$$1$0#

#&7$Delphia##br#
"I have a very bad feeling about all of this, %n%.#br#
 A VERY bad feeling..."#br#
 Delphia's voice warbles as she watches Agatha leave. #M327090$Delphia$1$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You're just about to step forward and console Delphia like the concerned friend that#br#you are when you're approached by yet aNOTHER middle-aged woman.#char$$823$$0$0#

#&7$Desperate Mother##br#
"I-Is this the Order of the Falcon? Oh, please! You must help me!#br#
 My son! I can't find my son! I don't know what to do!#br#
 P-please, you have to help me! I have no one else to turn to..."#br#
 Big, salty tears stream down the woman's face as she clasps her hands together. #M501040$Desperate Mother$827$57$1$0#

#&7$Delphia##br#
"Good heavens! There, there, miss. It's all right. Please try and#br#
 calm down. You need to let us know what happened!"#br#
   #M327090$Delphia$823$$0$0#

#&7$Desperate Mother##br#
"M-my little boy... he's only seven years old! He's out there somewhere!#br#
 Earlier today he-... he ran off into the Ventari Fields, and I haven't seen him since!#br#
 Please, I'm begging you! If something happened to him, I could never... never..."#br#
 Her shoulders shake as a fresh burst of sobs wracks her frame. #M501040$Desperate Mother$827$57$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 The woman's cries cut through your heart like a serrated bread knife.#br#
 Patting your chest, you assure her you'll set off at once for the Ventari Fields and find the boy!#br#
 After all, when the life of a child is at stake, there isn't a moment to lose!#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Delphia##br#
"Thank you, %n%. And good luck. Please let me know if you need#br#
 any help? I'll stay here and look after this poor woman while you search.#br#
 And-... and do be careful, all right?" Delphia's tone darkens, and despite everything,#br#
 you can't help but worry this could be connected to the recent turn of events... #M327090$Delphia$4$$0$0#|
10842|#&7$Delphia##br#
"Please be careful, %n%. With everything that's gone on lately, it's hard#br#
 to know what to expect out there." Delphia's eyes cloud with worry. #M327090$Delphia$4$$1$0#|
10843|#&7$%n%##br#
 You return to the Falcon's Nest to find Delphia once more drowning in work.#br#
 A quick look around reveals the boy's mother to be nowhere in sight.#br#
 Curious, but seeing as Delphia is currently occupied, you sit down nearby to wait.#char$$1$$0$0#

#&7$Simón##br#
"¡%n%! ¡Mi chamo! ¡Cuánto tiempo sin verte! Long time no see, my friend!#br#
 What is with all these many people? I can scarcely even see my own paws!#br#
 Did poor Simón miss an announcement of import? Me quedé como la guayabera..."#br#
 Simón's ears droop in reproachful desolation as he surveys the crowd. #M825010s100+30$Simón$4$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Seeing as you've got some time on your hands with Delphia occupied,#br#
 you ask Simón what he's doing in the Falcon Nest. It's not often you see#br#
 him straying from his perch in front of the Lapitaro Lodge.#char$$4$$0$0#|
10844|#&7$Garth##br#
"Yeesh, %n%! Thought I was gonna be cleanin' up your dismembered#br#
 limbs for a moment there. Whaddya think you're doin' sneakin' up on a#br#
 guy settin' MINES?!"#br#
 Garth tries to catch his breath, sweating like a stuck pig. #M329090$Garth$823$53$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Breathing hard yourself, you take a few weary steps towards Garth and wipe the#br#
 sweat from your brow before telling him about the lost boy. Garth hadn't possibly#br#seen him around somewhere... had he?#char$$821$$0$0#

#&7$Garth##br#
"Lost kid? Ain't heard nothin' 'bout a lost kid. I've been busy mole-bombin'!#br#
 Pesky little critters. Had to bring in the big guns, if you know what I mean.#br#
 Anyway, maybe some of the locals in the village know about your kid."#M329090$Garth$821$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 The two of you (slowly) meander back towards an outcropping of houses. A crowd#br#
 has formed next to the gate, all of them out to watch Garth's mole-bombing attempt,#br#no doubt. Just as you're about to ask about the lost boy, the crowd disperses without a word.#char$$2$$0$0#

#&7$Garth##br#
"Hey! Where y'all goin'? Thought you wanted to wait around to see the pile o'#br# mole corpses!" Garth's brow furrows as he watches the remaining stragglers slip#br#
 of sight.
   #M329090$Garth$823$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Now you're SURE something fishy is going on. You quickly fill Garth in on what's#br#been happening back in the Falcon's Nest and how you think this might be connected.#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Garth##br#
"Now that you mention it, that IS awful oddball. Hmm... how 'bout this, Sprocket?#br#
 I'll continue scoutin' for that lost boy o' yours—see if I can get some of these folks#br# outta their hidey-holes—and you get back to the nest to make sure nothin's goin'#br#
 down there. Let 'em know 'bout what's happened, too."#br#
   #M329090$Garth$821$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You nod in zealous affirmation, then turn on your heels and take off for the nest.#char$$806$$0$0#|
10845|Search for the lost boy|
10846|Get outta there!!
|
10850|Agatha has yet to report in, and the number of incidents continues to rise. Bain mentions some of the Dragomon have been acting strangely, so Delphia suggests you see if Lenora can't use her Dragomon-whispering skills to see what's the matter. You don't want to appear complacent in front of Bain, so you accept immediately and make tracks.

*Find Lenora, then accept assignments from the Hunters' League to continue your training.|
10851|#&7$Delphia##br#
"You're probably wondering about that lost little boy, aren't you?#br#
 Well, he came running back almost as soon as you'd left! I feel like#br#
 such a fool sending you out on all these pointless assignments. And here#br#
 Agatha even WARNED me to stop accepting suspicious quests!"#M327090$Delphia$826$56$1$0#

#&7$Delphia##br#
"Speaking of Agatha, I haven't seen or heard from her since she left.#br#
 I do hope she hasn't gotten herself into any trouble. I know she can take#br#
 care of herself, but I just... everything is SO out of sorts, lately! It's giving me nightmares..."#br#Delphia runs a weary hand through her hair with a sigh. #M327090$Delphia$2$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You reassure Delphia with a few carefully-picked words of encouragement, #br#
 then segue immediately into your meeting with Garth in the Ventari Fields.#br#
 You explain how the villagers there had been acting entirely out-of-sorts, and you#br#wonder if it couldn't be related to your current series of unfortunate events.#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Bain##br#
"Agatha left?" All of a sudden, you hear Bain's voice from behind you, and#br#
 you turn to see the (rather bedraggled-looking) platinum-blonde making his#br#
 way across the nest. #M310090$Bain$351$$1$0#

#&7$Delphia##br#
"Oh, Bain! You're back from the field?"#br#
 You don't miss the look of utter relief that washes across Delphia's face.
   #M327090$Delphia$1$$1$0#

#&7$Bain##br#
"What's this is all about?"#br#
 Bain's hands go to his hips as he looks back and forth between the two of you. #M310090$Bain$821$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 It seems Bain hasn't been around for any of the recent events. You and Delphia quickly#br#
 fill him in on the mysterious happenings, the impossible assignments, and the strange#br#behavior of the villagers. You finish by telling him of Agatha's plan to investigate and#br#how she'd left to tail the noblewoman.#char$$821$$0$0#

#&7$Bain##br#
"Interesting..." Bain brings a hand to his chin, eyes narrowing.#br#
 "I've noticed a change in Dragomon behavior myself—normally docile#br#
 creatures attacking without warning. Still others collapsing for no reason..."#M310090$Bain$821$$1$0#

#&7$Bain##br#
"Still... we can't let something like this bring down morale." Bain nods his head,#br#
 giving your shoulder a reassuring pat. "Try to keep your head up. We'll figure this out."#br#
The comment is directed at you, but you can't help feel it was just as much for Bain's#br#
 own benefit as yours. #M310090$Bain$4$$1$0#

#&7$Delphia##br#
"You're right, Bain. We're the Falcons, after all! We could never let ourselves#br#
 fall to pieces over something as little as this." The smile finally returns to Delphia's#br#
 face. It boosts your own spirits as well.
   #M327090$Delphia$1$51$1$0#

#&7$Delphia##br#
"If the Dragomon are acting strangely, perhaps there's something we can do about it.#br#
 Maybe there's a simple solution to this whole debacle! %n%, why don't you go speak#br#
 with Lenora? If there's anyone who could read into what's going on, it would surely be her!" #M327090$Delphia$4$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You nod your head. Why hadn't you thought of that? It would give Lenora#br#
 a chance to put her talents to good use, as well. Thinking of Lenora reminds you#br#
 of Agatha, though, and you ask if there's anything you should be doing in her regard.#char$$806$$0$0#

#&7$Bain##br#
"Not sure we can. Unless she contacts us first, we don't even know where#br#
 to look for her." Bain shakes his head, glancing down at a crack in the#br#
 cobblestone and kicking it with his toe. "We'll have to wait."
   #M310090$Bain$4$$1$0#

#&7$Bain##br#
"She'll be back." Another nod, but his expression doesn't change this time,#br#
 lips pressed tightly together in grim uncertainty.
   #M310090$Bain$1$$1$0#

#&7$Bain##br#
"%n%, you-... we should... just keep all of this on the down low for now, all right?#br#
 Even if Agatha can't deal with this...#br#
 I hope you'll continue to work to improve your skills#br#
 so that you be well trained for future challenges." #M310090$Bain$821$$1$0#

#&7$Bain##br#
"And make sure you don't breathe a word of this to anyone outside the Falcons!"#br#
 Bain looks at you sternly to make sure you've understood him.
   #M310090$Bain$4$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You promise Bain that as soon as you've spoken with Lenora,#br#
 you'll go back to training and wait for news of Agatha. The#&46$Hunters' League##br#
  should be an ideal place to train....Nobody there will ask you about anything private. #char$$4$$0$0#|

"Oh, erm, right. I suppose there's always THAT. I mean, if you're really#br#
 that desperate for work and all. Not that I would ever force you to go on#br#
 assignments for my companion! Imagine! The chairman of the Hunter's League!#br#
 They'd never let me live THAT one down at the monthly meeting, ahaha... ha..." #M308060$Angel$821$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"No problem, right, %n%? We've got nothing else to do!#br#
 Plus we're supposed to be training. Two birds with one stone!"#br#
 %p%'s ears salute with a crisp flick.#pets100+30$%p%$831$$0$0#|
10854|#&7$Lenora##br#
"Oh, %n%! It's been so long! I do hope you've been well."#br#
 Lenora's face lights up upon your arrival, and you can't help but smile. #M324090$Lenora$822$51$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 After a quick greeting, you tell Lenora about the situation at the Falcon's Nest.#br#
 You wonder if she hasn't felt any strange... off-kilter vibes or something from#br#any Dragomon as of late that could explain their strange behavior.#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Lenora##br#
"Now that you mention it, I did feel a strange disturbance not too long ago. It was faint,#br#
 convoluted, and hard to grasp—like trying to catch dust in the light—but certainly there.#br#
 I would be happy to look into this more thoroughly." Lenora's face softens as she speaks,#br#as if she were attuning herself to the natural world where she stood. #M324090$Lenora$821$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You thank her, reminding her to be careful before you leave. None of you#br#
 know exactly what you're up against, after all.#char$$821$$0$0#

#&7$Lenora##br#
"Oh, I will, %n%, but thank you. I only hope that I'm able to help..."#br#
 Lenora smiles—though you can sense the worry in the way her#br#
 lip trembles—before starting to gather up the materials necessary for#br#
 her investigation. #M324090$Lenora$822$$1$0#|
10855|#&7$%n%##br#
 Remembering your promise to Bain to continue your training, you decide to head on over#br#
 to the Hunters' League. That way, you can get paid while you train your skills...#br#
 You could use a little extra coin to help pay the bills, after all.

#&7$Angel##br#
"%n%! My old pal! My old confidante! My number one assignment-busting aficionado!"#br#
 Angel's voice is loud and boisterous as he bids you welcome. His expression, however,#br#
 darkens as soon as you approach. "What's wrong, kid? Somethin' on your mind?"
  Angel, acting like a concerned uncle. gives you a worried look. #M308060$Angel$821$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Bain's voice runs through your head. Right! Keep it secret; keep it safe...#br#
 Best to leave Angel in the dark for now. You shrug off his question,#br#
 saying you're under the weather and ask if any new assignments have come in. #char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Angel##br#
"You should really take it easy if you're not feeling well, you know...#br#
 Can't keep you away, though, can it? You hunters are all alike! You'd#br#
 never let somethin' like a little illness keep you from furthering your#br#
 skills!" Angel laughs, his stomach shaking like a bowl full of jelly. #M308060$Angel$824$$1$0#

#&7$Angel##br#
"Well, if it's assignments you want, go check in with #&46$Clerk Avonlea#!#br#
 You'll find her in the Fountain Square. Heard she just got in a new batch of requests—#br#
 real tough ones, too! Sure to keep that insatiable training palate of your whetted." #M308060$Angel$4$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You thank Angel and beat a hasty retreat lest you arouse his suspicious any more.#br#
 Time to find this #&46$Clerk Avonlea# in the Fountain Square!#char$$822$$0$0#|
10856|#&7$%n%##br#
 Your long list of assignments complete, it seems like the perfect time to return to the#br#
 Falcon's Nest and make sure there haven't been any updates. First, however, you make#br#one last stop by Angel in the Hunters' League—you're never one to miss an opportunity#br#to gossip, after all.#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Angel##br#
"%n%! Get over here, you rascal! I heard all about it from Avonlea!"#br#
 You're about to question what "it" could be, but Angel's jolly side-hug wrenches the#br#
 air from your lungs. "You're finishing up these assignments like who laid the chunk!#br#
 No one can even keep up with you anymore! Sometimes I wish you were MY child..." #M308060$Angel$4$51$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Finally separating yourself from the overly-clingy chairman, you straighten your#br#
 clothes and fluff up your hair. Strange, though, that nothing seems to be amiss in the#br#league. You'd think whatever was affected the order would be affecting the other#br#unions as well, wouldn't you? At any rate, you should get over there and check...#char$$822$$0$0#|
10860|Bain's finally returned, and he brings with him a report that Dragomon on Ventari Hill have been increasingly aggressive as of late. It seems like the best place to start looking for clues—and he asks specifically for YOUR help!

Once you've calmed the flustered beating of your heart, take the gearcopter to Ventari Hill and meet up with Bain.|
10861|#&7$%n%##br#
 Just as you're about to ask Delphia for an update on the current situation, you hear an#br#
 abrupt cough from behind you, and turn to find Bain having just arrived, his face grim.#char$$2$$0$0#

#&7$Delphia##br#
"Oh, Bain! You're finally back. Have you... discovered anything?"#br#
 Delphia's voice quiets towards the end of her question, as though she#br#
 were unsure she truly wanted to know the answer. #M327090$Delphia$4$$1$0#

#&7$Bain##br#
"There's a large group of Dragomon up on Ventari Hill.#br#
 More aggressive than any others I've seen. If we want clues,#br#
 that's where we'll find them." Bain runs a tired hand through his hair. #M310090$Bain$821$$1$0#

#&7$Bain##br#
"%n%, you're coming with me. I'll need your help.#br#
 You blink your eyes—wondering, for a moment, that you'd misheard him.#br#
 Bain? Coming to YOU for help? This is... this is... well, you're not sure what#br#it is, but you feel a little proud inside. #M310090$Bain$4$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You nod your head emphatically and tell him you're happy to help with#br#
 whatever he needs. It's time for Jack and Jill to go up the hill! You just hope you#br#can fetch your pail of water without breaking your head open...#char$$4$$0$0#|
10862|#&7$%n%##br#
 You catch Van Pelt arguing with someone you've never met before as you walk by.#br#Probably best to leave them be for now...#char$$1$$0$0#|
10863|#&7$%n%##br#
 You return to the nest to report to Van Pelt, only to find him in the middle of#br#a—well, "discussion" might be the best way to put it—with a number of the other Falcons.#char$$1$$0$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"All right! All right! Could everyone just... just calm down?#br#
 One at a time, people! There's only one of me and fifty of you, so just..." #M330090$Van Pelt$4$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 The crowd has Pelt backed into a corner like a caged dog. You're not even sure#br#
 you can REACH Pelt! What in the world is all this hubbub about?#char$$2$$0$0#
|
10864|#&7$%n%##br#
 When you finally meet up with Bain, you can tell something's wrong. His face is grim,#br#and his lips are pressed together tightly as his eyes roam the environs.#br#Not enTIREly different from his normal expression, but different enough for#br#you to notice.#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Bain##br#
"I just got word that we're needed west of here.#br#
 Someone's in need of our assistance. We need to hurry."
   #M310091$Bain$4$$1$0#|
10865|#&7$Bain##br#
"I didn't get a good look at it, but it was definitely SOMEone."#br#
 Bain continues to survey the perimeter as you approach.
  
   #M310091$Bain$1$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You admit you're not even sure you saw something yourself.#br#What makes Bain so sure it was a person?#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Bain##br#
"I can feel it." Bain draws his sword, slicing the air in front of him with#br#
 a deft flourish. You can tell something's really bothering him.#br#
"Whoever it is, they're good. Staying just out of sight at all times."#br# He nods to himself, eyes narrowing. Always remember to respect your foe, %n%.
   #M310091$Bain$821$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Bain's apprehension is contagious, and you find yourself glancing back over your shoulder#br#even as you speak. If this person is that good, could they be involved in the recent#br#goings-on back in the nest?#char$$1$$0$0#

#&7$Bain##br#
"Wouldn't surprise me." Bain's fist tightens around the hilt of his blade.#br#
 "What worries me most is the fact that we seem to be their sole target."#br#
He thrusts the tip of his sword into the dirt with a low grunt.
   #M310091$Bain$1$$1$0#

#&7$Bain##br#
"I'll keep looking around here. You report to Van.#br#
 Tell him to stop sending out Falcons on assignments.#br#
 We're going to need all the help we can get..."#br#
   #M310091$Bain$4$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You nod your head in affirmation and head back towards the gearcopter. What could#br#
 all of this mean? Why would anyone want to harm the Order of the Falcon? You shake#br#your head, trying to rid yourself of the thought, but even as you run, you can feel your#br#stomach flip-flop uneasily.#char$$822$$0$0#|
10870|You arrive back at the nest just in time to see Van Pelt take a verbal lashing from a group of livid Falcon cadets. Seems like it's some kind of political uproar involving another union not holding their weight.

Just as you're wondering who you should report to, then, about what happened on Ventari Hill, Delphia informs you that Garth has returned! Good old Garth! Better get to the old kook, pronto!|
10871|#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"Look, OK? The other union has already apologized!#br#
 This is really out of my hands at this point..."#br#
 Pelt groans, his last nerve having been nearly worn away. #M330090$Van Pelt$826$56$1$0#

#&7$Union Leader##br#
"Sure, nothing went horribly wrong this time, but what about next#br#
 time, Pelt? We don't show them we're serious and we only set ourselves#br#
 up for more! What'll you do then? How much will they have to do before#br#
 a simple apology just won't cut it?" #M326090$Union Leader$4$$0$0#

#&7$Cadet##br#
"Exactly what I was trying to say earlier!#br#
 We've gotta let them know that we reFUSE to just... just...#br#
 let them walk all over us! We're falcons, not hummingbirds!" #M307090$Cadet$825$55$0$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"I know, I know. Look, I'm just as angry about everything as you, but letting#br#
 our emotions get in the way will only make things worse for everyone involved.#br#
 I'll have a talk with their representative and make sure everyone's concerns are heard."#br#
 Despite Pelt's best efforts, the crowd's anger doesn't seem to have been assuaged. #M330090$Van Pelt$821$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You're just wondering whether you should make your own#br#
 presence known when you feel a gentle tap on your shoulder.#char$$2$$0$0#

#&7$Delphia##br#
"%n%, come with me for a moment, would you?"#br#
 Delphia's voice tickles your ear. #M327090$Delphia$4$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 As she pulls you away from the flock of angry Falcons, you take the#br#opportunity to ask what's got everyone in such a kerfluffle.#char$$821$$0$0#

#&7$Delphia##br#
"Ah... you wouldn't know about that, would you? Politics, really, but..." She pauses,#br#
 as if searching for the right words. "A short while ago, we Falcons joined forces#br#
 with another union to hunt down a large Dragomon It's not rare—these group hunts, I#br#mean. They're an opportunity for unions to cooperate and grow."#M327090$Delphia$821$$1$0#

#&7$Delphia##br#
"During the fight, however, not only did the members of this other union end up fleeing,#br#
 they also somehow attracted a number of other Dragomon to the area, leaving#br#
 the remaining Falcons to clean things up. Though we were successful in felling the brutes,#br#we took a great many casualties..."#M327090$Delphia$4$$1$0#

#&7$Delphia##br#
"Something like this would never have happened in the past. You can see the whole#br#
 order is up in arms about it. I suppose Van will be stuck smoothing things out for who#br#
 knows how long... It's these types of politics that make my head hurt, truly!" #M327090$Delphia$826$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 But if Van Pelt is busy playing diplomat, who are you supposed to#br#
 report to about your findings on Ventari Hill? You'd like to point out that#br#
 you have more important things to be dealing with than a few disgruntled#br#union members, but you're not sure it's your place to do so...#char$$1$$0$0#

#&7$Delphia##br#
"That reminds me, though—Garth just recently got back from the#br#
 field. Perhaps he has news? You should check in with him. He could#br#
 potentially have stumbled upon something." Delphia tilts her head to the side#br#
 in that way that always makes you think she knows more than she lets on. #M327090$Delphia$821$$1$0#|
10872|...|
10873|#&7$Garth##br#
"Sprocket! Good to see ya. You're lookin' a little razzled.#br#
 Everything OK? That mine incident didn't give you the runs, did it?#br#
 I got stuff for that." Garth looks up in the middle of packing up his tools. #M329090$Garth$4$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You quickly shake your head, then relay the events that transpired on#br#
 Ventari Hill—the aggressive Dragomon, the mysterious shadow, Bain's#br#notion that someone's out to get the Falcons!!!#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Garth##br#
"Whoa, whoa, whoa, don't get yourself worked up into a little tizzy, Sprocket.#br#
 Nice and slow. Deep breaths." But even as he attempts to calm you down, you can#br#
 see the worry etched into his own face. He stops packing his tools and stands up. #M329090$Garth$821$$1$0#

#&7$Garth##br#
"Remember the way those villagers in the fields were acting? All suspicious-like?#br#
 Well, I asked around. Turns out some kind of emissary from the government paid#br#
 them a visit. Strange, right? Way out in the fields? And NOW of all times? #M329090$Garth$4$$1$0#

#&7$Garth##br#
"This emissary bloke gathers up eeeeveryone in the village for reasons #br#
 they themselves didn't know! But then? Finally just lets 'em go without another#br#
 word. Weird, right? Way out in the fields? And NOW of all times?#br#Wait, I already said that, didn't I?" #M329090$Garth$826$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 The shadowy figure on Ventari Hill, weird government emissaries gathering people up,#br#
 a growing dispute regarding another union... Something's definitely going on here.#br#
 There's no way none of these things are connected! Bain might just be onto something...#char$$1$$0$0#

#&7$Garth##br#
"Maybe... HA! Maybe the government plans on marching everyone through the landmines!#br#
 Go, good citizens! Frolic in the fields! Then... BOOM!! Bwahaha... ahaha... erm... yeah..."#br#
 Garth's laughter dies off as soon as he looks at your thoroughly affronted look of disbelief. #M329090$Garth$824$$1$0#|
10880|Just as you and Garth have found yourself short of answers, a messenger from the Falcons rushes up in panic. It seems crazed Dragomon have begun launching attacks all over Everfrost Berg and the Frostbite Forest! The citizens there are fighting for their lives! 

What with the shortage of staff back at the nest, it looks like it's up to you and Garth to save the day! Make your way to the berg—quick!—while Garth investigates the forest.|
10881|#&7$Garth##br#
"Seems like the Falcons just can't catch a break lately.#br#
 If only there were some way to just ride this out..."#br#
 Garth shakes his head morosely, seemingly out of ideas.
   #M329090$Garth$826$56$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 As you attempt to think up your own brilliant idea, a Falcon messenger#br#
 suddenly rushes up to the two of you, completely out of breath.#char$$2$$0$0#

#&7$Falcon Messenger##br#
"G-Garth! It's... oh god, it's... you've gotta... we can't..."#br#
 The boy can barely get out more than two words between#br#his much-needed gulps of air. #M301090$Falcon Messenger$503$56$1$0#

#&7$Garth##br#
"Taaaake it easy there, cogbutton! That's it. Take a nice deep breath.#br#
 You pass out on us and you're useless anyway!" Garth chuckles to himself,#br#
 but pats the boy's shoulders all the same in an attempt to calm him down.
   #M329090$Garth$821$$0$0#

#&7$Falcon Messenger##br#
"It's just... the Dragomon, they're... running wild! It's like they're crazed!#br#
 They're attacking villagers and settlements alike all throughout Everfrost Berg#br#
 and the Frostbite Forest! It's a disaster!" #M301090$Falcon Messenger$825$$1$0#

#&7$Falcon Messenger##br#
"I rushed back as quick as I could to get help, but... the nest it's...#br#
 practically empty! Where'd everyone go? That's why... that's why I#br#
 came to find you! I thought maybe you could help..." The boy coughs,#br#
 wiping the sweat from his brow, but finally begins breathing normally. #M301090$Falcon Messenger$4$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 With a few carefully-selected words of confidence, you assure the boy that you and#br#
 Garth will do everything in your power to help and put a stop to this madness.#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Garth##br#
"My thoughts exactly! Now, come on, %n%! We're not doin' anyone any good#br#
 sittin' around like toads on a log! Let's get out there! Time to teach these Drago-critters#br#
 what happens when they mess with the great Gartholomew Roberts!" #M329090$Garth$821$$1$0#

#&7$Garth##br#
"The faster we can cover more ground, the better, so I say we split up.#br#
 If you take care of the berg, I'll take care of the forest. Sound good?#br#
 And keep those eyes of yours open, Sprocket! Don't let any clue go undetected!#br#
 We need answers! Not ambiguous hogwash! Now, get your rear in gear and let's go!" #M329090$Garth$4$$1$0#|
10882|#&7$Delphia##br#
"How I hope that everyone is safe..."#br#
 Delphia murmurs nervously to herself, eyes trembling. #M327090$Delphia$2$$1$0#|
10883|#&7$%n%##br#
 You arrive back at the Falcon's Nest to see Van Pelt and Delphia discussing the recent incidents.#br#You can see the worry on Delphia's face from all the way across the nest.#char$$1$$0$0#

#&7$Delphia##br#
"Van! Over there! %n% and Bain are back!"#br#
 Delphi practically rushes towards you, unable to contain her relief. #M327090$Delphia$4$$1$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"Excellent. We were just beginning to worry."#br#
 Van Pelt shoots the two of you a wink before crossing his arms#br#
 over his chest. "Seems a lot of things have been going on while#br#I've been up to my ears in political nonsense." #M330090$Van Pelt$4$$1$0#|
10884|#&7$Bain##br#
"Blast... and here we could have finally gotten some answers.#br#
 I'm so STUPID!" Bain throws his sword on the ground in a fit of anger.#br#
 You've never seen Bain this rattled before, and you're taken aback#br#
 for a moment, not quite sure what to say. #M310091$Bain$825$55$1$0#

#&7$Bain##br#
"%n%? What are you doing here?"#br#
 Composure restored—though the red not quite gone from his face—he#br#
 calmly picks up his sword, sheathing it with a clank. #M310091$Bain$1$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You relay the emergency distress signal from the messenger earlier in Elysium,#br#
 as well as how you and Garth hurried off to save as many as you could. Garth could need#br#help over in the forest!#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Bain##br#
"Understood. We should move quickly.#br#
 Once we find Garth, we can talk more about this."#br#
 Despite Bain's confidence, the slight tremble in his voice#br#
 is evidence enough that he's been thoroughly shaken. #M310091$Bain$4$$1$0#|
10885|#&7$Bain##br#
"%n%, look!"#br#
 Bain points to a snowbank just up ahead.#br#
"That's Garth's tool crate, isn't it?" #M310091$Bain$4$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You cautiously brush the snow aside, fear curling in your lungs,#br#
 and sure enough, lying half-buried in the powder are a screwdriver and a wrench.#br#
 Garth would NEVER have just left these behind. His tools are his life! Could something#br#have happened to him?#char$$823$$0$0#

#&7$Bain##br#
"Blast it all..." You can see the anger well up in Bain's eyes again.#br#
 He shoves his sword into the snow with a grunt. "If only I could#br#
 have caught that stupid girl, then we-..." You can see his shoulders#br#
 sink, and it makes your own heart hurt. #M310091$Bain$825$$1$0#

#&7$Bain##br#
"...there's nothing else out here for miles."#br#
 Bain shakes his head, voice listless.#br#
"And the two of us won't last much longer out#br#
 in the snow like this. We should head back to the nest." #M310091$Bain$1$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You know Bain would never suggest as such if he didn't really mean it.#br#
 If he even thought there was a CHANCE, he would... he would...#char$$1$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You glance back over at him. He's practically supporting himself on his sword.#br#
 Much longer out here and he's sure to collapse. Stepping forward, you take his arm#br#
 with a reassuring nod, and the two of you make your way back to the nest.#char$$806$$0$0#|
10886|Watch Bain's confrontation with the Masked Girl|
10890|As Pelt's still got a mess of things to work out in the nest, it's up to you and Delphia to begin searching for your missing Falcon companions. Delphia hands you a map and asks if you couldn't interview some of the city patrol members for clues. If there's anyone who'd notice something suspicious going on in the city, it's them!

Check the map for their daily routes, then see what kind of salacious slander you can dig up! Regarding the recent incidents, yes, of course...|
10891|#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"All right, let's try and cover all our bases here. Who's still here at the nest?" #M330090$Van Pelt$4$$1$0#

#&7$Delphia##br#
"Hmm... well, Agatha's been missing since she left to trail that noblewoman.#br#
 Lenora still hasn't returned from when she left on her Dragomon investigation a short#br#
 while ago..."#M327090$Delphia$822$$1$0#

#&7$Delphia##br#
"Nash is still on that assignment you sent him on over in the east...#br#                                          
 Atelia's still away at that alchemy conference she always attends...#br#
 And Garth is, well..." She turns towards you in hopes of an explanation as to#br#
 his whereabouts. #M327090$Delphia$821$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You sigh with a shake of your head, informing her that Garth had left for Frostbite Forest#br# 
 after the two of you had split up, but when you and Bain had gone searching for him#br#
 later, all you'd found were his tools.#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Bain##br#
"There were tracks at the site. They probably belong to that girl from earlier."#br#
 Bain practically snorts with indignation. "Whoever she is... whoever THEY are...#br#
they've got us right where they want us. I can't STAND it." Unable to keep it in anymore, #br#
 he launches his fist at the nearby wall. You've never seen Bain this furious before. #M310090$Bain$821$$1$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"Bain, Bain... come on, now. Getting mad at yourself won't help anyone."#br#
 Pelt's hand goes to Bain's shoulder, and he calmly guides him back towards the group.#br#"I think I may have a hunch as to what's going on..." #M330090$Van Pelt$4$$1$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"We Falcons have always been about hunting. It's our credo, if you will.#br#
 And we're good at it, too. This order's been around long enough that we have#br#
 it down pat. What we don't have down, though, is other people. Other unions, to be more#br#specific. Unions which could see us as competition.#M330090$Van Pelt$1$$1$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"The more I think about it, the more it seems like there's no other explanation.#br#
 There COULDN'T be another explanation! We've explored every angle, yet we've#br#
 come up with nothing, and that's precisely because we've been ignoring the people#br#
 around us." Pelt's hands go behind his back as he paces back and forth. #M330090$Van Pelt$4$$1$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"For the time being, I'll suspend all assignments. Our new—and only—assignment,#br#
 now, is to recover our missing colleagues. I don't want ANYone going out alone#br#
 anymore, you got that? I want teams only from now on. I'm not about to let anyone#br#else go missing."#M330090$Van Pelt$821$$1$0#

#&7$Bain##br#
"Van, I'm afraid you'll have to excuse me. Time isn't on our side, as I'm sure#br#
 you understand, and there's something I need to do."
   #M310090$Bain$822$$0$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"...you're right. You're free to go. Just... be careful.#br#
 I can read you like a map, Bain. Don't do anything rash."#br#
 Pelt narrows his eyes, but ultimately gestures for Bain to leave. #M330090$Van Pelt$4$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You watch as Bain walks off. He's lost the confident swagger you're so used#br#
 to identifying him with. Each new person gone makes the nest feel that much emptier.#char$$2$$0$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"I, unfortunately, still have to sort out this hunting dispute nonsense...#br#
 %n%, you go with Delphia and see if you can dig up any new leads,#br#
 would you? At this point, we can use all the clues we can get."#br#
 Pelt brings a hand to his forehead and massages his temple. #M330090$Van Pelt$4$56$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You can tell from his eyes, from his stance, from the way his fist clenches and unclenches#br#
 at his side—he would give anything to be out there searching for his companions#br#himself. You nod, determined to be his eyes and ears while he's stuck taking care of matters#br#in the nest.#char$$806$$0$0#

#&7$Delphia##br#
"%n%, I have a few last minute issues to attend to here, but could you start#br#
 checking in with our patrols? Take this map—I've marked here the routes our#br#
 patrols follow throughout the day. There's a chance at least one of them might have#br#
 seen something. I'll meet up with you as soon as I'm finished." #M327090$Delphia$4$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You grab the map with a nod, assuring her you'll do your best to question#br#those guards until they can be questioned no more!#char$$821$$0$0#|
10892|#&7$Delphia##br#
"Were you able to find anything, %n%?"#br#
 Delphia wrings her hands nervously, eyes imploring. #M327090$Delphia$4$$1$0#|
10893|#&7$%n%##br#
 Still trying to make heads or tails of what you've discovered, you hurry back to#br#
 Delphia in the Falcon's Nest, filling her in on everything you've seen—the disappearance#br#
 of the patrol guards, the fresh scuffle marks, the terminal debauchery-!!#br#
 Well, maybe you made that last part up...#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Delphia##br#
"It... it can't be true! It simply can't be! Whoever this is has even gone so far#br#
 as to capture our guards, now? What could they be planning? What do they#br#
 want from us?" Delphia shakes her head morosely, bead of sweat working#br#
 its way down her temple. #M327090$Delphia$4$$1$0#|
10900|Finally finished with her work, Delphia informs you that Lenora had mentioned something about restless Chillizards in Frostbite Forest before she'd left. If you're going to find anything, she believes that would be the best place to look.

You couldn't agree more. Lenora's gotten herself out of a fair number of scrapes in the past, but this might be one scrape that scrapes back! Hurry to the gearcopter and make for the forest! You only hope you're not already too late...|
10901|#&7$Delphia##br#
"All right. I've finished everything I needed to here in the nest. We should hurry!#br#
 Come. We'll look for Lenora first. Perhaps it will give us some answers, too." #M327090$Delphia$4$$1$0#

#&7$Delphia##br#
"Right before she left, she mentioned something about the restless aura surrounding#br#
 the Chillizards in Frostbite Forest. If I had to take a guess, I'd say that's our best place#br#
 to look. Oh, Lenora... I pray she's all right. She wouldn't be able to defend herself if... if..."#br#
 #M327090$Delphia$821$$1$0#

#&7$Delphia##br#
Delphia shakes her head, and when she turns back to you, there's nothing but#br#
 steely determination in her eyes. "We must be swift. Perhaps we'll be able to find#br#
 some kind of clue there." #M327090$Delphia$4$$1$0#|
10902|#&7$Delphia##br#
"Come, %n%! We must move quickly.#br#
 Who knows how much time we have left!"#br#
 A flame the likes of which you've never seen#br#has erupted behind Delphia's eyes. #M327090$Delphia$4$$1$0#|
10903|#&7$Delphia##br#
"At last, this whole mess is over... I'm just grateful that everyone's safe and#br#
 sound back in the nest. If that's the only good thing to come out of all this, then#br#
 that's fine by me." Delphia shakes her head with a weary—but relieved—sigh.
   #M327090$Delphia$4$$1$0#|
10904|#&7$Masked Girl##br#
"Greetings, Falcons. You're looking delightfully droll as always."#br#
 The girl extends her hand to you and Delphia respectfully. #M043020$Masked Girl$822$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 She surprisingly slender, and judging by her odd style of dress, she doesn't#br#
 seem to be a fighter. You remember what happened in her encounter with Bain,#br#
 though. The power she wields is nothing short of extraordinary.#char$$822$$0$0#

#&7$Delphia##br#
"Is there... something you want from us, ma'am?"#br#
 Delphia's hands are raised in a defensive posture.#br#You can tell she senses something amiss. #M327090$Delphia$4$$0$0#

#&7$Masked Girl##br#
"Oh, no. Nothing I want from YOU, my dears. I've simply gotten my hands on some...#br#
 information you might be interested in." The girl pulls a piece of jewelry from her pocket,#br#
 dangling it almost teasingly from her finger. You swear you've seen it somewhere#br#
 before...#M043020$Masked Girl$4$$1$0#

#&7$Delphia##br#
"Th-... that's Lenora's! It's YOU! Where is she? What have you done with the others?!"#br#
 Delphia immediately raises her staff, no longer content with mere suspicion and#br#
 going straight to accusation.
   #M327090$Delphia$825$$0$0#

#&7$Masked Girl##br#
"Done? I've done nothing, let me assure you."#br#
 The girl shakes her head with a low chuckle. #M043020$Masked Girl$4$$1$0#

#&7$Masked Girl##br#
"My dear, dear girl... You're looking for love in all the wrong places."#br#
 She begins twirling the bracelet back and forth around her finger.#br#
"You haven't even bothered to look... closer to home?" #M043020$Masked Girl$821$$1$0#

#&7$Delphia##br#
"Wh-... what? You can't mean-?!"#br# Delphia blinks incredulously, then gasps#br#
 as though hit by a sudden realization.
   #M327090$Delphia$823$$0$0#

#&7$Masked Girl##br#
"While you fritter your time away with me, another of your companions#br#
 is fighting for his life. Have you no heart, Delphia? Surely, you don't#br#
 wish him any ill will..." #M043020$Masked Girl$4$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Could she be referring to... Bain? No! Sure, you'd normally think Bain capable of#br#
 handling himself in any situation, but you're starting to think whoever this is you're#br#
 up against doesn't play fair. Then again, what if... what if this is just another trap?#char$$826$$0$0#

#&7$Delphia##br#
"What makes you think we're going to simply believe you?"#br#
 Delphia practically spits on the ground in her anger.#br#
 You've never seen her this close to losing it before.
   #M327090$Delphia$825$$0$0#

#&7$Masked Girl##br#
"Believe me. Don't believe me. It's totally up to you."#br#
 The girl begins walking away, pausing for a moment to set Lenora's bracelet#br#
on a nearby stone. "I'm just the messenger." Without another word, she vanishes#br#
 into a whirlwind of blinding snow, disappearing from sight.
   #M043020$Masked Girl$822$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You run over to the stone, gingerly picking up the bracelet and handing it to Delphia.#br#
 You're at a bit of a loss. Do you try and find Bain? Could it all be a trap? You shake your#br#head, all of this just a little too much to take in.#char$$821$$0$0#

#&7$Delphia##br#
"...we don't have much choice. We need to find him.#br#
 This is truly Lenora's bracelet, which means..."#br#
 Delphia curls her fingers around the glittering beads, jaw tight. #M327090$Delphia$1$$1$0#

#&7$Delphia##br#
"%n%, if something happens—if anything happens—I want you to#br#
 get back to safety. Back to the nest. Don't worry about me... all right?"
   #M327090$Delphia$4$$1$0#|
10905|#&7$Bain##br#
"...hngh..."#br#
 Unable to hold himself aloft any longer, Bain collapses#br#
 in the snow. You and Delphia rush to his side. #M310090$Bain$503$$1$0#

#&7$Delphia##br#
"Bain! Don't try and move, all right? I'll see what I can do.#br# The poison is spreading through your veins, but I might be able#br#
 to do something to slow it down." Delphia readies her staff with a flourish,#br#
 but you can tell by her grim expression that the effects must be serious.
   #M327090$Delphia$823$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 As Delphia readies her spell, you help Bain to a more comfortable position,#br#
 propped up on a nearby rock. You ask what happened. Who did this?!#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Bain##br#
"I-... I tracked her here... that girl... from earlier...#br#
 I almost... HAD her... but I was... was charged by... a pack of#br#
 Dragomon. Dragomon that shouldn't even... be in these parts..."#br#Bain lets out a phlegmy cough, his body trembling.#M310090$Bain$503$$1$0#

#&7$Bain##br#
"I tried to... to fend them off... but while I was distracted, someone-..."#br#
 Another cough. "...someone shot me with that... that dart..."#br#
 Bain points weakly towards the dart still in your hands.#M310090$Bain$503$$1$0#

#&7$Bain##br#
"I tried to... stay conscious... so I could confront... whoever it was..., but-...#br#
 ...they must have... nngh-... escaped..." Bain winces, his face frighteningly#br#
 pale. You throw an arm over his shoulder to keep him warm until Delphia's finished#br#treating his wounds. #M310090$Bain$503$$1$0#

#&7$Delphia##br#
"This dart, it-... looks familiar somehow..."#br#
 Delphia kneels down beside you—her spell complete—and takes#br#
 the dart from your fingers. Her eyes narrow in intense scrutiny.
   #M327090$Delphia$821$$0$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"That's because you've seen it before. We all have. It's the signature weapon of our#br#
 WONderful friends, the #&46$Copperheads#." You turn around in surprise to#br#see Van Pelt trudging up the nearby hill to join you. #M330090$Van Pelt$351$$1$0#

#&7$Delphia##br#
"Van?! What are you doing here?" Delphia pushes herself to her feet with a start.   #M327090$Delphia$823$$0$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"Was on my way to DEAL with said #&46$Copperheads# up at the frozen lake.#br#
 You know, settle that lovely dispute between us that's been giving me so much delightful#br#
 grief these past few weeks? I'm just as surprised to see you three here. I'd call this a#br#happy surprise if the situation didn't make me wanna gouge someone's eyes out." #M330090$Van Pelt$4$$1$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"Those slimy, good-for-nothing b—... sorry, forgot there were children around."#br#
 Pelt turns apologetically towards you, then takes the dart from Delphia to get a closer look.#br#"Finally revealing your true colors, are you? Copperhead, scum." His words hiss between#br#his teeth. #M330090$Van Pelt$1$$1$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"At least we're onto them, now. Who knows what I'd have found myself into all by#br#
 myself in the middle of the snake pit, so to speak. But if THEY know that WE know...#br#
 Pelt rubs his chin, and you can practically see the cogs trying to turn in his head.#M330090$Van Pelt$821$$1$0#

#&7$Bain##br#
"The girl I was-... following..." Bain shakes off your arm and gets to his feet with#br#
 a wobble. "She was... heading in that direction... too..."#br#
 You can tell Delphia's spell has started to take effect—some of the color#br#
 has returned to Bain's face. He still shouldn't be clambering around, yet, though! #M310090$Bain$821$$0$0#

#&7$Delphia##br#
"Bain! The poison has barely left your system! And don't get me started#br# on the physical wounds still littering your body." Delphia darts to the man's#br#
 side, taking a hold of his shoulder just before he nearly collapses again.
   #M327090$Delphia$823$$1$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"Bain... how are you feeling?"#br#
 Pelt walks up to Bain, his voice so low you can barely hear it. #M330090$Van Pelt$4$$1$0#

#&7$Bain##br#
"Fine, Van. Perfectly-... fine."#br#
 Bain brushes away Delphia's grip on his arm and snaps to attention, one arm#br#
 up in a crisp salute. You can see it just barely tremble against his forehead. #M310090$Bain$822$$0$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
Pelt watches him for a moment, and you can tell he's weighing his options.#br# Finally, he nods his head. "All right, then... could I have you, Delphia, and %n%#br#
 join me for the negotiations? Less chance of something happening the more#br#
 heads we've got. We inquire directly, and we might get some solid answers."
   #M330090$Van Pelt$4$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 The three of you nod without thinking, ready to shove off. Ready to get to the#br#
 bottom of this and find your colleagues... whether it kills you or not.#char$$806$$0$0#|
10906|Ambush|
10910|It seems this latest run-in with the Copperheads was the last straw for a lot of Falcon members already on edge—people are dropping out of the order left and right! And assignment acquisition is at an all-time low, to boot.

Delphia is—understandably—worried about the fate of the guild, and asks you to check in with Pelt. Perhaps he has some kind of glorious plan to save everyone from the frying pan? You just hope it won't send the lot of you back into the fire...|
10911|#&7$%n%##br#
 Your wounded colleagues currently bedridden and still others simply taking some#br#
 much-needed time to rest, the Falcon's Nest seems considerably cold and cheerless#br#as you make your way back to Delphia for the latest updates.#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Delphia##br#
"So many casualties... I can't even bear to think of it. And now we even#br#
 have some of our members threatening to resign! This dispute has caused#br#
 too much uproar. Van has tried to reason with them, but it seems most#br#
 of them have made up their minds..."#M327090$Delphia$1$56$1$0#

#&7$Delphia##br#
"Almost no new assignments have come in, either. I fear for the future of#br#
 this order. If we keep losing members, there won't even BE an order before#br#
 too long. I'm not sure what Van plans to do... Perhaps you could go talk to him, %n%?" #M327090$Delphia$4$$1$0#|
10912|...|
10913|#&7$%n%##br#
 You meander over to Van Pelt and find him knee-deep in conversation#br# with a rather... all-too-familiar slender figure. You take a step back,#br#
 startled, at first, then sidle up beside Agatha to see what's going on.#char$$823$$0$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"So... you're part of the Runeblades, is that it? Yes, I'm familiar enough#br#
 with the name, but I've never had any—shall we say, confirmation?—on the#br#
 rumors that've been floating around. Nobody even knows where you're from.#br#
 What your intentions are? What, exactly, do you gain by helping us?" #M330090$Van Pelt$821$$1$0#

#&7$Masked Girl##br#
"If you would have a look at this letter..."#br#
 The girl takes out an envelope that's been sealed tightly with#br#
 a wax stamp, smiling ever-so-sweetly as she hands it to Pelt. #M043020$Masked Girl$822$$0$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"Mysterious letter, hm? The mysteries never end!#br#
 Let's take a little look-see, shall we?#br#
 Forcing a smile—and bowing his head almost patronizingly—Pelt#br#
 accepts the letter and scans his eyes over its contents. #M330090$Van Pelt$4$$1$0#

#&7$Masked Girl##br#
"I've been observing you for some time, good Falcons. It goes with the#br#
 territory when one is chronicling the rise and fall of unions, after all."#br#
 As such, I have also paid close attention to your, shall we say, rival unions?"#br#You spy the hint of a smirk as she repeats Pelt's phrase back at him. #M043020$Masked Girl$822$$0$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"Isn't that just precious? What, pray tell, have you discovered amongst all these#br#
 secret 'observations,' hm?" Agatha's as sharp as always, thoroughly unimpressed#br#with this girl's decorum. #M320090$Agatha$821$$1$0#

#&7$Masked Girl##br#
"Oh, quite a few things, actually! Many of which don't exactly relate to the matter#br#
 at hand..." The curls lips curl upwards impishly. "But more importantly, I've determined#br#
 your union has reached a crucial impasse of vulnerability. It seemed only natural that#br#I should attempt to aid those in crisis, yes?" #M043020$Masked Girl$4$$0$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"Wh-... you-... you-!! You think you can just, I don't know, walk all over us?!#br# We're not some third-rate tea club who can't take care of themselves!"#br#
 Agatha stamps her foot down, and you can already see the all-too-familiar#br#flames of asperity building inside her. #M320090$Agatha$825$55$1$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"Agatha, Agatha, Agatha... just hold on there a second, would you?"#br#
 Pelt sidles his way in-between the two women with his hands raised.#br#
"I think we've come to an understanding." Letting out a somewhat weary#br#
 sigh, he slowly folds the letter back up.#M330090$Van Pelt$821$$1$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"Alright! Everyone listen up!" Pelt claps his hands as he turns towards the rest of the nest.#br# "From this moment forth, this girl is officially a member of the Order of the Falcon!"#br#
 His voice resounds off the nearby walls, and everyone within hearing distance turns and stares.
   #M330090$Van Pelt$4$$1$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"I expect you all to treat her as you would any other colleague—like family!#br#
 Am I TRANSPARENTLY clear?" He glances over at Agatha, one eyebrow raised.
   #M330090$Van Pelt$821$$1$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"All right! Now that that's all done and accounted for, care to introduce yourself?#br#
 Hard to get familiar with someone without knowing their name, after all."#br#
 He rubs his hands together with the slightest of awkward chuckles. #M330090$Van Pelt$821$$1$0#

#&7$Ukyo##br#
"Greetings, everyone. My name is Ukyo. Ukyo Runeblade."#br#
 Ukyo smiles—almost charmingly—just beneath her mask.
   #M043020$Ukyo$822$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You wait for her to continue, expecting a little more after all that build-up.#br#
 Everyone else in the nest seems to have reached the same conclusion,#br#
 and a dull silence hangs in the air.#char$$1$$0$0#

#&7$Ukyo##br#
"I, erm... I said my name is Ukyo! Did you not hear me?"#br#
 She repeats herself, flinging her arms out to her either side.#br#
"You asked for an introduction, didn't you? So, I... I..."#br#
 Ukyo stares out into the silent crowd, at a loss for words, when suddenly... #M043020$Ukyo$4$$0$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"Bwahaha!!"#br#
 Pelt bursts into laughter, hands to his stomach as he fights back tears. #M330090$Van Pelt$824$51$1$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"Oh, god... I can't..." He loses it to another giggle-fit. "I can't keep this#br#
 whole straight-laced, stiff-shirt act up forever. This isn't like me!"#br#
 He wipes a tear from his eye with a little whistle. "I get it, I get it...#br#
 I FINALLY get it." He nods his head once, twice, then turns towards the crowd. #M330090$Van Pelt$826$51$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You, on the other hand, along with the rest of the nest, are left wondering#br#
 what exactly is so side-splitting (and why you'd been left out of the joke).#char$$1$$0$0#|
10920|Van Pelt, a bit of his former self returning, seems to have banished the dark clouds that had been hanging over his head. He boldly proclaims that from that moment on, the Order of the Falcon would strive to stay one step ahead of the game and never let another union get the best of them again. How's THAT for motivational speeches?|
10921|#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"Don't you get it? We're always SO FOCUSED on hunting. It's Dragomon#br#
 this, and Dragomon that. We run head-first into one perilous hunt after another#br#
 that we completely lose sight of everything else. Namely—HUMAN competition." #M330090$Van Pelt$821$$1$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"If this order is to keep on tweeting its falcon song, we're gonna have to take our blinders#br#
 off and stop ignoring the rest of the world. A union is more than hunting, after all. It's a group#br#
 of people! With goals, ambitions, dreams... and in this great, big world of Wyveria, there#br#
 exist MANY such unions. It only makes sense that we'd have... communication problems." #M330090$Van Pelt$4$$1$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"Sure, we're facing a few dire straits, at the moment, but that won't keep us from#br#
 ploughin' through this walk of life like the sultans of swing that we are!#br#
 It's time we hone our skills, temper our resolve, and be better prepared to face whatever#br#
 the future may hold!" Van Pelt points his head skyward, his chest swelling with pride.
   #M330090$Van Pelt$824$$1$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
It's silent again as Pelt's words sink into the minds of each of your Falcon comrades.#br#
 Then, finally, Agatha begins clapping slowing. You can see the inklings of a smirk on#br#her face. "Heh. Looks like Pelt's back to his old self again." #M320090$Agatha$4$51$0$0#

#&7$Ukyo##br#
 Ukyo herself is still silent, but you can see a small smile forming on her face, as well. #M043020$Ukyo$822$51$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You admit, Pelt's miracle motivational speech did a number on your own mood—in#br#
 a good way! It seems like everything feels off when Pelt feels off around here. The whole#br#atmosphere of the nest seems to have lightened somewhat.#char$$806$$0$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#

"Excellent work, %n%. And it's just as I thought. It was about#br#

10924|#&7$%n%##br#
 Atelia is all smiles when you knock on her door and ask for a few minutes#br#
 of her time. She also has a good laugh when you relay Pelt's grand speech outside#br#in the nest.#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Atelia##br#
"That old boggart! Sounds like something he would say, hm? As for what happened#br#
 to me, though, well, I can't say it's all that exciting. I was on my way back from my#br#
 conference, yes? Oh, darling! You should have BEEN there! I learned so much. Brought
 SO many materials back with me... I couldn't wait to dive into them!"#M328090$Atelia$2$51$1$0#

#&7$Atelia##br#
"Which I did, actually. On the way home, I took a little pit stop to have a go at one of my#br#
 most PRECIOUS new texts. Strangely, I hadn't been reading but five minutes or so when#br#
 I felt the strangest sensation come over me! Like a haze. And then? Black. I'm afraid I#br#
 don't really remember much after that." She tilts her head to the side with a small shrug. #M328090$Atelia$4$56$1$0#

 Nodding to yourself, you quickly scribble down her version of the events before#br#thanking her for her time and shoving off to find your next witness.#char$$822$$0$0#|
10925|#&7$%n%##br#
 You find Nash still recovering in one of the beds in the infirmary. He seems well enough#br#
 for some light conversation, so you immediately ask him for full details of the night he was#br#brutally attacked.#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Nash##br#
"Injustice! That's what it was. A bunch of... of... double-crossing scoundrels who#br#
 didn't have the decency to take me head on! We'd been out on a hunt together, even! Then, as#br#
 soon as the beasties had been dealt with, they turned on ME! Can you imagine? Of course,#br#
 I put up a fight as well as I could, mind you. Took out a few of the heathens myself." #M322090$Nash$826$$1$0#

#&7$Nash##br#
"But what's a poor boy to do when faced with impossible odds and a gang of insatiable#br#
 hoodlums out to rob him of his innocence?! It was horrible! Simply horrible!#br#
 I can't believe you're making me recall of all this! Especially still weak and vulnerable#br#
 as I am, now..." Nash brings the back of his hand to his forehead with a languid sigh. #M322090$Nash$825$55$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You're fairly certain there were a few, erm, "embellishments" added to his story,#br#but you jot everything down anyway and thank him for his time.#char$$822$$0$0#|
10926|#&7$%n%##br#
 You find Lenora in her usual spot, though looking a bit more bedraggled#br#
 than you're used to seeing her. You ask if she wouldn't mind telling you a bit about#br#when she was attacked.#char$$821$$0$0#

#&7$Lenora##br#
"The attack? Hmm... that's right. I was... yes! I was helping the Chillizards#br#
 fight back against a strange, ominous magic permeating the forest. That's right.#br#
 And then, I-... I remember... some kind of obstruction. I don't quite recall what it was.#br#
 It reacted to my magic and... there was some kind of explosion..."#M324090$Lenora$821$$1$0#

#&7$Lenora##br#
"The only thing I remember after that is the cry of the Chillizards. It all went black..."#br#
 Lenora shakes her head, eyes narrowed in intense concentration. "The only explanation#br#
 I can come up with is that I triggered some sort of... of... trap! I'm not quite sure."#br#
 She rubs her temples as if trying to massage more info from her memory. #M324090$Lenora$826$56$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You tell her not to fret—you should have enough info here to help your case! Thanking#br#her once again for her time, you quickly jog off, anxious to get your findings back to Pelt.#char$$822$$0$0#|
10927|#&7$%n%##br#
 You find Garth over in his home on Rambler's Lane. He seems well enough—answered#br#
 the door in his jammies and everything!—so you ask if you might have a few words about#br#what happened the night he was attacked.#char$$821$$0$0#

#&7$Garth##br#
"Just thinking about it makes me... me... rrraargh!" He abruptly punches the nearby door#br#
 frame, making the whole house shudder. "I'd just cleared out the last of the fiends from#br#
 the forest, right? Was just about to pat myself on the back, right? When suddenly?#br#
 Ambushed! Buncha hunters appeared outta nowhere and walloped me!" #M329090$Garth$825$55$1$0#

#&7$Garth##br#
"When I finally get back to the nest, I looked ALL over for those galdurned backstabbers,#br#
 but they were gone! Like a coupla farts in the wind. Even asked around town, but#br#
 no one seemed to recognize their descriptions at all. It's like... they don't even exist!"
   #M329090$Garth$821$$1$0#

#&7$Garth##br#
"So, I've narrowed it down to two conclusion. One—everyone in town is lying to me!#br#
 Or two—whoever attacked me was just disGUISED as a hunter to get me to let my pants#br#
 down, so to speak. As I seriously doubt there's a village-wide conspiracy against me,#br#
 I'm gonna say option two is slightly more plausible, you get me?"#M329090$Garth$826$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You jot everything down in as great a detail as you can, then thank Garth for his time#br#and assure him you'll fill Pelt in on everything.#char$$822$$0$0#|
10930|You feel like you've really done it this time. You've never seen Pelt as proud of you as he was on this day! Now, if only certain OTHER Falcon members would do the same... Speaking of the devil, Pelt suggests you find Agatha. It's been a while since the two of you connected on a close, personal level, and who would you be if you weren't anxious for close, personal connections?

Agatha should be somewhere in the nest...|
10931|#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"I've gotta hand it to you, %n%. You took this whole debacle pretty well.#br#
 I'd even say you handled it in STYLE! Just you wait. You'll become a sturdy pillar#br#of guidance for this order in no time, mark my words!" #M330090$Van Pelt$821$51$1$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"For the time being, why don't you report back in to Agatha?#br#
 S'been a while since the two of you could play master and commander, yeah?#br#
 I've got some cleaning up of my own to do..." Van Pelt motions to the stack of papers#br#practically falling off his desk and and forces the world's least convincing smile. #M330090$Van Pelt$4$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You nod, throw him a crisp salute, then take your leave.#br#
 As you're walking away, you hear him ram his knee into the desk,#br#
 which is followed by the sound of paper piles falling to the floor.#br#You smile at the string of unrepeatable words that follow.#char$$1$$0$0#|
10932|#&7$Delphia##br#
"....."#M327090$Delphia$4$$1$0#|
10933|#&7$Delphia##br#
"Oh, %n%! I really must thank you for all your help these past few days.#br#
 I don't know WHAT we would have done without you! And I'm sure everyone else#br#
 in the order agrees." Delphia is all smiles again now that the storm clouds have#br#lifted and order has returned to the nest. #M327090$Delphia$4$51$1$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"I suppose I'd have to agree. As your mentor and all, it, you know...#br#
 brings me great pride, yes! To see a young apprentice improve so quickly.#br#
 And all that. Very much so. Yes." Agatha looks mildly uncomfortable,#br#
 but you know she's trying her hardest. You even see the glimmer of a smile! #M320090$Agatha$4$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Deeply moved, you thank them both for their kind words, but—as always—remind#br#
 them that you still have much to learn. The wise man never forgoes an opportunity#br#to better himself, after all.#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"That's the ticket! See, that's what I like about you, %n%. You never let these things#br#
 get to your head." Agatha grins and slaps your back. The impact rattles your skull.#br#
 "True enough, though. Sure, we pulled through this time, but who knows what kind#br#
 of dangers await us in the future, right? Can't let yourself be caught unawares!" #M320090$Agatha$821$$1$0#|
10940|The storm may have passed, but there's no doubt in Agatha's mind that the recent happenings were merely a taste of what's to come. With Pelt's rousing speech, the Falcons have officially welcomed open competition with other unions, and you have a feeling there are a few that would LOVE to give the order a run for its money.

The only thing to do, then, is train! Train hard! Train fast! Train what your momma blessed you with!

And, like always, it seems like the best way to do so—and to pick up some new materials for crafting—is to stop by the Hunters' League...|
10941|#&7$Agatha##br#
"%n%. You've come a long, long way since you first stepped off that gearcopter.#br#
  You also happened to have seen us at some of our worst, I have to admit. We've#br#
 certainly had a slew of tough times lately, but you've pulled through like a trooper.#br#
 I might even... have to admit that I-... I-..." Agatha's brows furrow in seeming pain. #M320090$Agatha$821$$1$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"I-... can see that we still have lots of work to do! Yes! I mean, think about it! Who#br#
 knows what kinds of dastardly, devious, diabolical unions will have a go at us next?#br#
 We might very well have opened our doors wide for the next attack! And let me tell#br#
 ya—outfoxing Dragomon is NOT the same as outfoxing PEOPLE." #M320090$Agatha$4$$1$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"We already nearly got bested. Unless we double our efforts and train hard for what's#br#
 to come, who's to say they won't best us next time? Are you with me, %n%? Are you#br#
 ready to let these enragement children inhale our fury?! They wanna mess with the#br#bull? They'd better be ready to deal with the horns!" #M320090$Agatha$821$$1$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
Agatha seems to snap out of her speech. "Erm, anyway... Pelt'll probably come up with #br#
 a new training schedule for you. Don't let that big teddy bear fool you. Cross him—and#br#
 and I mean REALLY cross him—and you better be ready to lose a few limbs. Don't#br#
 tell him I said that, though. He still hasn't quite... accepted that part of his past, yet." #M320090$Agatha$4$$1$0#|
10942|#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"I always used to think that becoming a hunter would be... I don't know, freeing? I'd be#br#
 able to spread my wings and fly—away from bureaucracy, away from this constant power#br#
 struggle, away from... from... well, all of THIS! All of exactly what I've gotten myself back into!#br#
 I guess it's like the old saying goes—speak of the devil and he'll appear." Pelt shakes his head.#M330090$Van Pelt$4$$1$0#|
10943|#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"%n%! Excellent. You're looking in fine form, yeah? Trainin' hard#br#
 or hardly training, am I right?" Pelt grabs you around the shoulder, and for a#br#
 a moment, you're half-afraid he's going to wrastle you to the ground.#br#
 "It feels like just yesterday you walked in here like a little lost puppy..." #M330090$Van Pelt$4$$1$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"And now look at you! My little baby's all grown up and saving us from dirty, sneaking#br#
 backstabbers! Almost brings a tear to my eye." Pelt finally releases his hold on you, and#br#
 you rub the back of your head in mild discomfort. "I want you to know that I'll never let#br#
 you or any of your colleagues down, you got that, %n%? Never! I swear on my axe!"
   #M330090$Van Pelt$821$$1$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"As for your training, I hope to get in a new batch of assignments soon enough. You can#br#
 be sure you'll be first on the list when it comes to the top pick, eh? I'll try and save you#br#
 the real doozies! It's like they say—there's no 'no' in 'assignment!' The more debilitating#br#
 they seem, the more you'll grow as a person and hunter! Never stop giving 100%!"

10950|Angel has just received an urgent assignment. He's asked you to handle it before reporting back to the Falcon's Nest.

10951|#&7$Angel##br#
"Ah...%n%, I know this is coming a bit last minute, but I've just received some 
 pressing assignments, and the deadline is rather tight... #br#
 I know you've just returned, but would you be able to help out?"#br#
 Angel looks at you, his eyes pleading that you'll agree.
   #M308060$Angel$4$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You nod to indicate your willingness, and Angel barely conceals his relief.#br#
 He gives you the details of the assignment and you ready your things to head out.#char$$806$$0$0#

#&7$Angel##br#
"Wait, wait...one more thing! I just remembered!#br#
 There were some people from Order of the Falcon who came by looking for you,#br#
 so once you've finished, you can head directly to the Falcon's Nest to find them.#br#
 Thanks again for your help on this, you're really doing me a big favor here!" #M308060$Angel$8214$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Leave it to us! We'll get this done in no time."#br#
  Always happy to help, especially when it means we get to pummel something!"#br#
 After saying goodbye to Angel, you and %p% depart.#pets100+30$%p%$821$$0$0#|
10952|#&7$Delphia##br#
"I keep hearing about this mysterious 'competition' recently. You haven't heard of it,#br#
 have you, %n%? It's just that I worry so, about my fellow hunters. I wouldn't want them#br#
 to, you know, join some sort of competition that I'm unaware of and, you know,#br#WIN, because I was unaware of it..." #M327090$Delphia$821$$1$0#|
10953|#&7$Delphia##br#
"Ah, %n%, you're back.#br#
 You must have really done Angel a huge favor! He's been talking about it#br#
 ever since you left! He's really becoming a big fan of you, and he's not the only one!" #M327090$Delphia$4$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You wave your hand dismissively to indicate that it was the least you could do,#br#
 and change the subject, asking Delphia why the Falcons are looking for you.#char$$807$$0$0#

#&7$Delphia##br#
"Oh, dear. This is a bit embarrassing. You see, it's not actually the order itSELF that#br#
 needs you, but instead, my companion, Karen. She said she had something MOST#br#
 important to tell you, though frankly, I couldn't imagine what it is. She refused to tell me!"#br#
 Delphia blinks owlishly with a shrug of her shoulders. #M327090$Delphia$4$51$1$0#

#&7$Karen##br#
"I didn't want to spoil the surprise is all, dear! I was rather proud of myself, after all.#br#
 Any girl deserves a bit of self-aggrandizing after a job well done, you see.#br#
 At any rate, if you had a moment to spare, I wanted your opinion on something!"#br#
 Karen gently unfurls a length of exquisite cloth woven from leaves and flowers. #M809010s100+30$Karen$821$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Golly gee! Is that a... a... a leaf scarf... whats-it? Yeah! A leaf scarf?#br# Looks a lot nicer than any of the ones I've seen in the store, though!"#br#
 %p%'s eyes widen like tiny, twin saucers.
 #pets100+30$%p%$831$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 The scarf has a distinct, tessellated wave that seamlessly combines plant and textile, and is#br#
 decorated with flower petals of a dozen, brilliant hues that glint and reflect in the sunlight.#br#
 It was clearly made by a skilled, artistic hand. Curious, you ask Karen if she'd knitted the#br#scarf herself.#br#
 #char$$806$$0$0#

#&7$Karen##br#
"Oh, darling, stop making me blush! But if you must know... YES!#br#
 I began teaching myself the craft only a fortnight or two ago. Lovely little#br#
 hobby. Keeps my paws busy and all. If you'd like, I could knit one for each#br#
 of you?" Karen brings a hand to her mouth in polite mirth, her eyes crinkling. #M809010s100+30$Karen$831$$1$0#

#&7$Delphia##br#
"It's positively MESmerizing, Karen! Oh, I love it! I simply love it! It's been#br#
 ages since I've done any knitting of my own... You don't suppose you could#br#
 teach me, do you? I'd love to get back into it..." Completely ignoring you and %p%#br#
 Delphia and Karen quickly descend into their own little world of knitting. #M327090$Delphia$821$$0$0#|
10960|Agatha's yet to return, and now even Bain's gone temporarily missing. Poor Delphia looks about ready to have an aneurysm! As there's nothing for you to do at the moment, you figure you might as well complete a few more assignments for the Hunter's League.

*Accept assignments from the Hunters' League to gain experience.|
10961|#&7$Delphia##br#
"Oh, %n%. I'm starting to grow worried. There's still been#br#
 no sign of Agatha, and now Bain has yet to report back in, either."#br#
 Delphia's eyes crinkle with concern. #M327090$Delphia$4$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You throw your own glance around the Falcon's Nest. Admittedly, the#br#
 whole place seems a bit more understaffed than usual. Something about#br#
 it makes your stomach twist and turn anxiously.
 #char$$826$$0$0#

#&7$Delphia##br#
"I'm afraid we still don't have anything for you to do, %n%.#br#
 I'll let you know when Agatha returns? Until then, you'll have to#br#
 find your own way to keep busy..." #M327090$Delphia$821$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You nod—thankful you'll have some time off to yourself.#br#
 Since you don't have much else pressing to attend to, you decide to #br#
 head over to the #&46$Hunters' League# to see if they have anything for you.#br#
 Some combat practice might not go amiss, and a bit of extra money couldn't hurt either.#char$$806$$0$0#|
10962|#&7$Delphia##br#
"There's still no word from Agatha! I'm really beginning to grow worried.#br#
 And now Bain's left, too... This whole situation is started to make my#br#
 head spin." Delphia brings a hand to her forehead, gently massaging her temple. #M327090$Delphia$4$$1$0#|
10963|#&7$%n%##br#
 Having nearly finished every single one of your current assignments,#br#
 you decide to pay a visit back to the nest for a change of pace—a much-needed break,#br#
 you know? Also you're anxious to hear if there's been any updates on Agatha's whereabouts.#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Delphia##br#
"I'm afraid not, %n%. Nothing! Absolutely nothing. It's giving me the most#br#
 terrible of ulcers sitting here fretting, but there's nothing else I can do."#br#
 Delphia hangs her head, her shoulders slumping in helpless abasement. #M327090$Delphia$826$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 It's been weeks, now, and there hasn't been any sign of Agatha OR Bain!#br#
 If only you knew where he'd GONE! Then you'd at least have somewhere#br#to begin your search.#char$$821$$0$0#

#&7$Delphia##br#
"He didn't say anything! Just took off in that usual Bain way of his,#br#
 said he had 'something to attend to,' and left! Really, no one tells me#br#
 anything anymore! You'd think as this order's secretary, people would#br#
 do me the decency of filling me in on these things." Delphia shakes her head. #M327090$Delphia$4$$1$0#

#&7$Delphia##br#
"As it stands, there's really nothing else for you to do. It would be nice#br#
 to have you on standby, though, just in case something crops up. Could#br#
 you do that for me, %n%?" #M327090$Delphia$4$56$1$0#|

#&7$Delphia##br#
"According to reliable reports, we're positive this is the once-dormant Dragomon,#br#

"Impeccable work, %n%. I should have expected no less!#br#
 It seems even the mighty Baemon was no match for you.#br#
 I would imagine you'll be riding high on this victory for some time!"#br#Delphia laughs into her hand, bubbly as ever. #M327090$Delphia$821$$1$0#|

"%n%, a surveying team recently found a giant undersea cave in the southwest.#br#
 They named it 'Seasnail Grotto,' and, according to their reports, a particularly powerful#br#

#&7$Delphia##br#
"This news is spreading like wildfire throughout veteran hunter circles.#br#
 It's only a matter of time before the other unions will attempt to slay the beast!" #M327090$Delphia$4$$1$0#

"If you'd like a shot at it, make sure you bring some strong and capable companions.#br#

 on supplies and gear before attempting to tackle him, yes?" #M327090$Delphia$821$$1$0#|

"I must say, I didn't think ANYONE could bring down the#br#

"They sure breed 'em young these days, don't they?#br#
 Heh. Well, all the more to ya. I think I've got just the weapon for you, kid.#br# See how this baby feels in your hands." Arbalest procures a weapon from the#br#
 boxes of supplies and places it in your hands. #M308020$Arbalest$4$$1$0#

#&7$Arbalest##br#
"It's an oldie, but a goodie. Seen a lot of battles, this one.#br#
 I know you'll do it justice, though. Give 'em heck out there."#br#
 Arbalest gives your shoulder a hearty pat before turning his#br#
 gaze towards the line of other Falcon hopefuls. #M308020$Arbalest$821$$1$0#

#&7$Nicola##br#
"Perfect. You should be all good to go, then!#br#
 Do make sure you #&46$equip the weapon#, yes?#br# Then, take this evaluation form to #&46$Shadis# over in the testing area.#br#
 Good luck, %n%! I'm sure you'll do wonderfully!" #M323090$Nicola$821$$1$0#|
11022|#&7$Shadis##br#
"Yes? Are you %n%?#br#
 I need to see your evaluation form."#M326090$Shadis$1$$1$0#|
11023|#&7$%n%##br#
 You hand Shadis your evaluation form and politely introduce yourself.
 #char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Shadis##br#
"%n%, hm? Your age belies your skill, it would seem, but don't get cocky just yet.#br#
 I'll be your examiner for this part of the evaluation. In other words, I decide#br#
 whether you have what it takes to be a Falcon. Try not to disappoint me."#br#
 Shadis stares at you blankly. Seems he'll be one tough cookie to impress. #M326090$Shadis$1$$1$0#

#&7$Shadis##br#
"Very well, then. If you're ready, we'll begin the first test."#br#
 Shadis calmly clips your form atop the pile of other recruits'#br#
 before narrowing his eyes in apathetic expectation. #M326090$Shadis$821$$1$0#|
11030|Ice Prince Shadis has asked you to demonstrate your skills in battle, and it seems like you're gonna need to knock his socks off, too!

Ready your weapon and give that training dummy what-for to prove your worth!|
11031|#&7$Shadis##br#
"I'll first need to observe your abilities in battle. No doubt, you've noticed#br#
 the #&46$training dummy# in front of you. That will be your target.#br#
 Demonstrate how you'd go about taking it down were it an enemy."#br#
 Shadis tilts his head towards the dummy before crossing his arms over his chest. #M326090$Shadis$821$$1$0#

#&7$Shadis##br#
"Every move you make from here on out will affect your score, so think#br#
 carefully before making your move. I want to see skill, not blind brutality."#br#
 You nod hesitantly. It seems all the loving encouragement was reserved#br#for the check-in desk!#br#
#br#
*Target the #&46$training dummy# and use the skills in your action bar to attack it.#M326090$Shadis$822$$1$0#|
11032|#&7$Shadis##br#

*Target the nearby training dummy and use the skills in your action bar to attack it. #M326090$Shadis$1$$1$0#|
11033|#&7$Shadis##br#
"Well, that was... I mean... you... huh. Interesting. Very interesting..."#br#
 Shadis's eyebrows curve upwards in twin, gloppened arcs.#br#
 It seems you caught him off-guard with that little onslaught. #M326090$Shadis$1$$1$0#

#&7$Shadis##br#
"All that talk about you wasn't just talk, I see—you've got some real skill there.#br#
 True, your approach and follow-through lack concision, and your footwork is a bit sloppy,#br#
 but for a new recruit, you show a lot of promise. I'll go ahead and pass you on the basic test."#br#
 Shadis begins hastily scribbling something down on your evaluation form. #M326090$Shadis$4$$1$0#

#&7$Shadis##br#
"Don't let my words give you a big head just yet, though.#br#
 Your test is merely getting started, as it were."#br#
 Shadis chuckles to himself and gives you a curt pat on the shoulder. #M326090$Shadis$822$$1$0#|
11040|It seems those training dummies were only a prologue to the main event. Now, Shadis wants you to see how you fare in real combat—against a pack of wild Forest Fungi!

Head over to the Proving Grounds to "prove" you're not all talk. If you can successfully take down three of the mushroid miscreants, you might just curry some favor with the stone-hearted examiner.|
11041|#&7$Shadis##br#
"These training dummies were nothing but child's play for you.#br#
 Why don't we move onto something a bit more... ambitious?"#br#
 Shadis throws an arm over your shoulder and directs you towards a nearby bridge. #M326090$Shadis$1$$1$0#

#&7$Shadis##br#
"Sure, you can hit stationary targets, but what about targets with a bit more innate bloodlust?#br#
 Do you see those #&46$Forest Fungi# scampering about near the waterfall over yonder?#br#
 Why don't you try taking out a few of those? Judging by what you demonstrated earlier,#br#
 you should have no trouble handling a measly morel or two."
   #M326090$Shadis$821$$1$0#

#&7$Shadis##br#
"I've already sent a few other recruits over there. Which recruit can take out#br#
 the most fungi, I wonder? We Falcons only take the best and brightest, after all...#br#
 Do try your best! I have the utmost confidence in you." #M326090$Shadis$822$$1$0#|
11042|#&7$Shadis##br#
"As I said before, you'll find the Forest Fungi gallivanting about the water to the#br#
 south. They're liable to camouflage themselves at the first sign of danger,#br#
 so you'll need keen eyes to spot them." #M326090$Shadis$1$$1$0#|
11043|#&7$Bain##br#
"Oh? A recruit? Were you the one who took down the wyvern?"#br#
 A strapping young man approaches you from the gearcopter.#br#His steely eyes narrow as he assesses the situation. #M310091$Bain$1$$1$0#

#&7$Belleza##br#
"Thank GOD, you're here! We almost had a major crisis on our hands, Bain."#br#
 Belleza's relief is evident in her voice as she wearily stumbles over. #M320032$Belleza$822$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Unsure what to do, you awkwardly bob your head in farewell#br#
 before shying away in hopes of reporting your results to Shadis.#br#
 Bain, however, wordlessly extends a hand to stop you.#char$$4$$0$0#|
11050|You can't believe it! THE Bain Blitzhardt, hard-boiled wonder boy of the Order of the Falcons, has written YOU a recommendation letter! He was right about the surprises, all right!

He's requested you report to the Falcon's Nest in Elysium to fill in the other Falcons on what's happened. Seems everything's coming up roses!|
11051|#&7$Bain##br#
"Leaving so soon?" You can see the man measuring you up with his eyes. Finally, he#br#
 gives you a curt nod. "Bain. Bain Blitzhardt. I'm a hunter in the Falcons." You hold your#br#
 hand out to shake in response, but he doesn't seem to notice. #M310091$Bain$1$$1$0#

#&7$Bain##br#
"Some show you put on here. You're here for the evaluations?"#br#
 Bain begins rummaging through his pockets and procures a pad of paper.
   #M310091$Bain$4$$1$0#

#&7$Bain##br#
"I have to investigate this mess. You report to HQ."#br#
 He hastily scrawls something on the pad of paper before#br#
 ripping off the sheet and carefully folding it in two. #M310091$Bain$1$$1$0#

#&7$Bain##br#
"Take this to the nest for me. I'll recommend you for enrollment. It's not often#br# we get recruits like you." Bain holds the letter out, and for just a moment, all you#br#
 can do is stare at him blankly, overwhelmed by this sudden series of events. Coming#br#
 to, you jerk back to reality and grab the letter with a rapid nodding of your head.
   #M310091$Bain$4$$1$0#

#&7$Bain##br#
"Speak with Omi, our pilot. He'll give you a lift to #&46$Elysium#."#br#
 Bain throws a glance in the direction of the gearcopter,#br#
 and you spot a goggle-clad Hoppalong in the cockpit. #M310091$Bain$1$$1$0#

#&7$Bain##br#
"It seems today is full of surprises. I look forward to working with you."#br#
 Bain bequeaths you another curt nod before turning on his heels to begin#br#
 his investigation. #M310091$Bain$1$$1$0#|
11052|#&7$Omi##br#
"Hey, kiddo! You the plebe ol' Bain's got his eye on? Name's Omi.#br#

11053|#&7$Omi##br#
"Whoo-wee! Feels good to stretch the ol' lobes, eh? Country#br#

11140|You get back from your misadventures with Hoppalongs for a lecture on taking assignments courtesy of Chairman Angel.

Completing a few seems like the best way to get more experience and earn a little dough in the process. Besides, with Agatha busy, you've got no choice but to train on your own for a bit.|
11141|#&7$Angel##br#
"Ah, right. Of course! Should have figured you'd ask about that.#br#
 Let's just cut to the chase, then, shall we? The Hunters' League!#br#
 One of the biggest unions here in Elysium and highly respected to boot." #M308060$Angel$826$$1$0#

#&7$Angel##br#
"The way it works is simple enough—#&46$accept assignments, complete assignments,##br#
 #&46$and get paid!# Pretty nifty, eh? Some commissioners will put restrictions on which#br#
 hunters can accept their assignments, though. Mostly because they don't want some amateur#br#
 Going out and getting themselves killed. So make sure you read the fine print!" #M308060$Angel$821$$1$0#

#&7$Angel##br#
"We get some pretty crazy assignments, sometimes. After all, there's all types.#br#
 Sometimes we even get new assignments for special occasions. You just never know!#br#
 That's why you should check with our receptionists regularly to keep#br#
 up-to-date on the newest, shiniest assignments." #M308060$Angel$4$$1$0#

#&7$Angel##br#
"For now, you'll be working on assignments located on the island next to the#br#
 Central Continent. If you go ask #&46$Vivian#, she'll get you all set up to #br#
 start working. Then you can #&46$hop through the Portal# to reach your location! #M308060$Angel$1$$1$0#

#&7$Angel##br#
"Ah, I almost forgot. Completing assignments can also increase your reputation within#br#
 the various unions of Elysium. Get enough of it, and you can even purchase special goods#br#
 from one of the Union Merchants scattered throughout town. Go find Wendel for more#br#
 info on all that. 'Fraid I'm not the most knowledgable one to ask about union goods." #M308060$Angel$4$$1$0#

#&7$Angel##br#
“Once you're all done with Wendel, stop by here and maybe I can give you a #&46$little something##br#
 ...that is, if you can raise that reputation of yours, eh? Think of it as an extra incentive. #br#
  Anyway, good luck out there!#br#Not that you'll need it, I'm sure." #M308060$Angel$822$$1$0#|

 There's nothing I don't know! Well... mostly." #M308060$Angel$822$$1$0#|
11143|#&7$Angel##br#
"Back so soon? You're faster than a mongoose wearing ice skates!#br#
 Anyway, here's that #&46$little something# I promised you earlier..."#br# Angel procures a small, copper badge from the inside pocket of his jacket.#br#
 giving it a little toss before placing it in your outstretched palm. #M308060$Angel$826$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 The badge is elaborately engraved—even the smallest of details readily evident in its design. You run your thumb over its rough surface. In the badge's center is a mighty hawk#br#
 with wings outstretched. It seems to be staring at you, fierce and infallible. Behind the hawk lie two crossed swords, adding to the imbued ferocity of the copper crest.
  
 #char$$806$$0$0#

#&7$Angel##br#
"This here is an official Falcon membership badge! Betcha weren't expecting that,#br# were you? Agatha asked me to keep an eye on you and let you have it if I was satisfied#br#
 with your performance. And, well, what can I say? Consider me satisfied!#br#
 You're now an official member of the Order of the Falcons." #M308060$Angel$4$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You're so startled, you almost drop the badge.#br#
 Not wanting to sound rude, but curious enough to risk it,#br#you ask how it is that Angel can have the final say in Falcon business.#char$$823$$0$0#

#&7$Angel##br#
"Ahaha, I know it may not make a lot of sense to you, but all the unions here in Elysium are so interconnected that#br#
 getting approved for one is like getting approved for all of them!#br#
 And I AM the Hunters' League chairman, after all..."#M308060$Angel$1$$1$0#

#&7$Angel##br#
"So long as you're an officially recognized member of the league, you can accept#br#
 any of the assignments we have to offer! Well, so long as you meet the#br#
 requirements, and all. And this badge is physical proof of that!" #M308060$Angel$4$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You find yourself entirely overwhelmed by this act of recognition, but finally—a bit#br#
 flustered—offer him your utmost thanks, while making sure to emphasize that you'll do#br#everything in your power not to let him down.#char$$822$$0$0#

#&7$Angel##br#
"Ahaha, thattaway, squirt! But you've already sped right through all the#br#available assignments for today, so how about we take a different approach?#br#
 There's actually someone I was hoping to introduce you to..."#M308060$Angel$826$$1$0#|
11144|#&7$Wendel##br#
"Awww right! Excellent! You must be that new recruit everyone's been gabbin' about, yeah?#br#
 Most pleased to make your acquaintance, hunter dude.#br#
 Name's Wendel. Old man Angel send you up here?" #M820010s100+30$Wendel$822$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You nod, glad you don't need to introduce yourself.#br#
 You add that you'd hoped to learn a bit more about Union Merchants.#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Wendel##br#
"Not much to explain, my righteous Romeo. All those assignments you can#br#
 flash your peepers at up on the old Hunters' League boards have already been#br#
 endorsed by their coinciding unions. So all YOU have to do is complete 'em, and#br#
 then you'll receive influence points for the union you so awesomely serviced. Get my drift?" #M820010s100+30$Wendel$831$$1$0#

#&7$Wendel##br#
"Get enough of that coveted kudos for any certain union, and you can buy#br#
 goods from their corresponding vendor! Some of us have got some stone-cold #br#
 selections, too. You'll most def wanna check back from time to time.#br#
 Come see us again soon, hunter dude!" #M820010s100+30$Wendel$4$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 So, different types of assignments will reward you reputation for different unions, huh?#br#
 It does sound simple enough, but you take a glance at some of the goods in the nearby shops#br#
 and realize you're going to need a lot more reputation first!#br#
 Better complete some more assignments.#char$$806$$0$0#|
11150|Craftsman Harris goes over the nuts and bolts of refining to you. Looks like refining is an essential part of hunter life that you'll want to acquaint yourself with quickly!

You'll first need to collect some materials, though, so head on over to one of the bulletin boards and complete a few assignments to reap the rewards.|
11151|#&7$Harris##br#
"Ah! Right! Now I remember!#br#
 I was about to learn you up on the wonders of #&46$refinement#!" #M329020$Harris$824$51$1$0#

#&7$Harris##br#
"A surefire way to give yourself the up-and-up when in the middle of a slugfest#br#
 is by refining your gear! Any hunter who's ANYbody knows how to take full advantage#br#
 of each piece of their equipment." You notice Harris giving your current gear a thorough#br#once-over with a click of his tongue. #M329020$Harris$4$$1$0#

#&7$Harris##br#
"Refining your gear boosts its stats. Each piece of equipment has its own #&46$bonus stat##br#
 that differs depending on its original crafting process. You keep on refining it and it'll,#br#
 keep getting stronger until you max it out. It requires a lotta time, love, and dedication, and#br#
 you might be wondering if it's all worth it, but hey—Elysium wasn't built in a day, baby!" #M329020$Harris$821$$1$0#

#&7$Harris##br#
"The other thing to take note about refinement is that it requires #&46$different##br#
 #&46$types of materials# depending on the gear and type of refinement. The best way to#br#
 go about resource collecting is by taking on assignments from the Hunters' League.#br#A lot of clients will give you materials as payment." #M329020$Harris$826$$1$0#|
11152|#&7$Harris##br#
"The more you refine your equipment, the more those bonuses will keep on stackin'!#br#
 It's a great way to turn duddy gear into GREAT gear! Heck, sometimes it's even#br#better than buying a whole new set!" #M329020$Harris$4$$1$0#|
11153|#&7$Harris##br#
"You can keep refining a piece of equipment until it reaches its #&46$maximum level#.#br#
 All you've gotta do is bring me the materials, and I'll do the rest. So what are you waitin' for?#br#

#&46$*Speak to Harris again to refine your equipment. ##M329020$Harris$821$51$1$0#|

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"What? You weren't s'pposed to—!! I mean, heeey, %n%! How's it dragon? Erm, HANGIN'!#br# Thought I'd come, check up on you like a properly wyverned—conCERNED leader#br#

 You doin' OK? No creepy reptiles infesting your dreams? Horrifying hallucinations? PTSD?"#br#
   #M330090$Van Pelt$826$56$0$0#

#&7$Delphia##br#
Delphia sighs and rolls her eyes—a unusual gesture coming from her.#br#
 "Can you talk like a proper, socialized human being, Van? I'm fairly certain #br#
 %n% is not going to scream if you say the word 'wyvern.' If anything, it's#br#
 your bizarre idiosyncrasies that are going to scare them off!"#br#
 Delphia crosses her arms in front of her chest as Van Pelt chuckles awkwardly. #M327090$Delphia$824$51$1$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"It's just, well, after we got back, I was suddenly afraid maybe we'd traumatized#br#
 the kid! You know, rushing them into life-threatening situations too quickly#br#

 of doing them the favor of having that Dragocite processed... free of charge!" #M330090$Van Pelt$821$51$0$0#

#&7$Delphia##br#
"Oh, WERE you? And was this approved by the order treasury? Last I checked, our#br#

"AHAHA! Let's not traumatize the child anymore than we already have, right? DELPHIA?#br#

 As soon as you approach Harris's smithy, his eyes light up, and he#br#escapes inside for a moment before returning with a small box. #M329020$Harris$2$$1$0#

#&7$Harris##br#
"I know exACTLY why you're here, %n%! Take a peep at that piece of#br#
 #&46$Dragocite# you collected. Now that's what I call a high-quality spit-shine!#br#
 Ain't nobody around who can refine that stuff like me!" #M329020$Harris$821$51$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Eyes full of wonder, you slowly open the box to reveal the most radiant,#br#
 gleaming piece of smoothly-polished Dragocite you've ever seen.#br#
 You don't even recognize it as the same rocky chunk from earlier!#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Harris##br#
"Dragocite is the most powerful stuff around. It can enhance your abilities ten, twentyfold!#br#
 Some Dragocite can even grant a hunter extraordinary powers. Did you ever wanna be#br#
 able to spew crazy-wild fire from your hand? Well! This Dragocite won't let you do that!#br#
 But some can. It takes an incredibly skilled hunter to be able to utilize that power, though." #M329020$Harris$826$$1$0#

#&7$Harris##br#
"The one thing you've gotta remember is this—the #&46$innate effects of a certain##br#
 #&46$piece of Dragocite can't be changed#... BUT! If you bring it to me, I can, let's say,#br#
 'tweak' it a little bit to #&46$manipulate those effects# in ways that'll better#br#benefit you, the hunter." #M329020$Harris$4$$1$0#

#&7$Harris##br#
"Now, all of that comes with a price on its head, of course, because as much as I like ya,#br#
 I ain't no charity! You'll need to fetch me the #&46$proper materials# for the type of#br#

"Quite thrilling, really! He and his crew were attacked by a monstrous creature of the deep,#br#
 and he was only able to escape by hiding himself in a barrel! But what he found on that#br#
 continent..." Delphia's eyes widen in rose-colored trepidation. "Human dragons, %n%!#br# An entire race of humans descended from dragons! Can you even imagine?" #M327090$Delphia$821$$1$0#

 the proverbial cliff, as it were. We've received countless requests to contact the author and#br#
 beg him or her to finish the story, but... well, that's just it! I don't know who the author#br# IS!" She rubs at her temple, eyes traveling back towards the massive pile of requests.
   #M327090$Delphia$826$56$1$0#

#&7$Delphia##br#
"I simply don't know what to do. Perhaps there's some sort of clue hidden within the#br#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You explain that while you weren't able to get any specific information about the#br#
 author, you WERE still able to nab a few juicy tidbits about the book itself. Everyone#br#
 you'd spoken to had mentioned a somewhat petite, masked merchant as being the#br#
 one selling it. Unfortunately, this same merchant had mysteriously disappeared...#char$$4$$0$0#

11520|Karen bemuses that the masked merchant in question might actually be a Hoppalong! And it only makes sense to ask other Hoppalongs about one of their own, right?

Ask some of the other Hoppalongs around Elysium to see if they might have any insight into this "masked" matter...|
11521|#&7$Delphia##br#
"Now that you mention it, that does seem like it could be likely! Indeed, more#br#
 likely than a half-sized human." Delphia giggles into her gloved hand. "You haven't#br#
 perhaps heard anything regarding this matter, have you, Karen?" #M327090$Delphia$2$$1$0#

#&7$Karen##br#
"Not a thing, my dear! Was just hazarding a guess. But really, it does make sense,#br#
 no? I highly doubt a child would be traversing about selling books, after all, and#br#
 the fact that this merchant was wearing a mask, well... clearly somebody wanted#br#
 to keep their identity hidden!" Karen demurely smooths the front of her dress. #M809010s100+30$Karen$824$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 It seems like as good a lead to follow as any! And what better way to catch a Hoppalong#br#than to go right to the source? You suggest asking the other Hoppalongs this time to see#br#if they might have any more information.#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Delphia##br#
"What a wonderful idea, %n%! You don't mind, though, do you? I feel like all I ever#br#do is send you off on one errand or another, but you DO take to them with SUCH relish..."#br#Delphia's eyes twinkle with something that's not quite chicanery and not quite not. #M327090$Delphia$822$$1$0#|
11522|#&7$%n%##br#
 You see Marvin in the distance furiously counting his fat stacks of cash.#br#The sight makes your fingers twitch...#char$$56$$0$0#|
11523|#&7$Marvin##br#
"Am I smart, or am I SMART? A real whizbang this thing turned out to be—a real#br# whizbang! Can't believe it, I simply can't believe it! A book! Nothin' but a book, but#br#the CASH!" #M812010s100+30$Marvin$824$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"MARVIN!"#br#
 %p% lets out a piercing shriek you hadn't even known they were capable of.#pets100+30$%p%$821$$0$0#

#&7$Marvin##br#
"Hah? Who's there, huh? Who's there? You ain't gettin' even a sniff of my money, you#br# hear? It's mine! Mine, see? So just back away slowly and forget you saw anything..."     #M812010s100+30$Marvin$823$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You quickly reassure Marvin that you've no interest in his money—what he doesn't know#br#won't hurt him—and that you're, in fact, here to inquire about the book, the Enchanted#br#Drachmar Chronicles.#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Marvin##br#
"The Chronicles, huh? Hoho, you've come to the right man, chap! I am, indeed, the author#br# of said acclaimed work of fiction. But I ain't writin' no sequel, see? Couldn't even if I#br# wanted to! Was just some story I heard from Lelouch. Thought I'd make a buck or two#br#
 novelizin' the thing, see? But that's it. There ain't no more!"

"Hm? Who's there? Oh, just YOU two. Well, I'm very, very busy! FAR too busy#br# to talk. Too busy to even THINK about talking! So you'd best be on your way, yes!#br#
 Just run along now, you hear?" Michaela barely even glances up at you, too busy#br#doing... something... #M807010s100+30$Michaela$605$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"We were just wondering if perhaps, you know, since you're sooooo knowledgeable#br#
 and beautiful and respected and all that, if you wouldn't happen to know anything#br#
 about the author of the Enchanted Drachmar Chronicles..." %p%'s ability to string#br#compliments like a pro never fails to impress you.#pets100+30$%p%$822$$0$0#

#&7$Michaela##br#
"WELL! You're certainly right in that I know basically everything there is to know#br# around these parts! It's only natural for someone as exalted as I. But I've been far too#br# busy to get my head stuck in some old book, so I'm afraid I won't be much help on this#br#
 matter. I've seen Omi carting that thing around, though... perhaps you could ask him?"  
   #M807010s100+30$Michaela$831$$1$0#|
11525|#&7$Omi##br#
"Well, button my bunions and curtail my collar! If it isn't %n%! What can I do ya#br#
 for, my bun-buttered compatriot? Missin' my food already? Cravin' that flavor?" #M803010s100+30$Omi$4$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Scenes of carnage flash through your head like brilliant beams of light right in your eyes#br#and burning your retinas. Your stomach flips once, then twice, and you're half-afraid#br#you're about to lose your lunch, but you're able to pull yourself together in time to#br#gasp out that you're not hungry at the moment.#char$$807$53$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"We don't have time for food! We've got more important matters to deal with. Like the#br# author of the Enchanted Drachmar Chronicles! We heard through the grapevine that you've#br#
 been running around with your own copy of the book... so spill! What do you know? To#br#
 think Omi would be interested in something other than food—that's a miracle in and of itself." #pets100+30$%p%$831$$0$0#

#&7$Omi##br#
"HA! That gaping maw is unbecoming on you, my dear, %p%. No need to look so#br# surprised! After all, there's a gargantuan creature of the deep in this book! And nothing#br# says 'I dare you to cook me' like a gargantuan creature of the deep. Every time I read it,#br#
 I imagine broiling that vicious sea demon in a giant pot... mm, leviathan stew..."
   #M803010s100+30$Omi$824$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Your eyes narrow in skeptical bewilderment. Sometimes you wonder if this Hoppalong#br#is real or if he's merely a manifested construct of hungry localizers' imagination. At any#br#rate, you shake your hand to get back to the topic at hand—the AUTHOR.#char$$827$56$0$0#

#&7$Omi##br#
"The author, huh? How'm I supposed to know?! Doesn't say on the book, does it? Then#br# it don't concern me! Not that it really would have anyway, but you catch my drift. 'Sides,#br#
 I only borrowed this book from Mholt. He's more likely to have the inside scoop on this#br#
 piece of A+ literature. Now then, so long as we're on the topic of food..."
      #M803010s100+30$Omi$831$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Before Omi can even finish his sentence, you've grabbed %p% by the scruff of their#br#neck and have hightailed it down the street. You hear Omi's voice calling out from#br#behind you, but you don't look back. You never look back.#char$$301$$0$0#|
11526|#&7$Mholt##br#
"Ah, if it isn't my bosom buddies, %n% and %p%... Alas, I'm not in the grandest of#br# moods at the moment, as I'm sure you've assessed for yourself. My grief seems to be#br#
 compounding itself by leaps every minute these days..." Mholt watches as a clump of#br#his hair falls—unprovoked—to the ground below. #M805010s100+30$Mholt$826$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Sorry to have walked in on your, erm... self-deprecation session, but we had a quick#br#
 question we wanted to fly by you." %p%'s eyes remain fixated on the fallen hair for#br#a moment before returning to Mholt's downcast eyes. "We heard you're the one who lent#br#Omi that book—the Enchanted Drachmar Chronicles?"#pets100+30$%p%$831$$0$0#

#&7$Mholt##br#
"Oh? Did I? I can't say I've any recollection of this book-lending. Then again, I've not much#br# recollection of anything at all these days. How could I? When nothing in my life holds any#br#meaning or value?" Mholt shakes his head, which only frees two more clumps of hair from#br#their loose-pored confines. "At any rate, what of it? Has something happened?" #M805010s100+30$Mholt$826$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Not 'happened,' so to speak, more like, well, we're performing an investigation! We're#br#
 trying to find the author. Wondered if you might have any clues? So far we've run into#br#nothing but dead ends!"#pets100+30$%p%$831$$0$0#

#&7$Mholt##br#
"The author? Of that book? Why, I believe it was Marvin, yes." Mholt's ears perk up#br#
 for the minutest of seconds before collapsing with a dismal flop. "Oh, dear, I've done it#br# again! He promised me not to tell and here I've gone and blabbed my big, fat mouth#br#
 to the entire peanut gallery! I'm the most wretched of Hoppalongs! Wretched, wretched!"
   #M805010s100+30$Mholt$826$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Mholt begins viciously yanking out tufts of hair from his head with a long, agonized#br#groan. You decide it's probably best if the two of you stop bothering him and grab#br#%p% by the ear. You need to go talk to Marvin anyway...#char$$2$$0$0#|
11530|So, it was MARVIN who wrote the Enchanted Drachmar Chronicles...

As strange as the juxtaposition seems, you've no time to ponder it long—you need to find Lelouch and see just what the story itself is all about!|
11531|#&7$Marvin##br#
"If you're that interested, I'm 'fraid you'll have to go see ol' #&46$Lelouch#, see? He's the one#br#
 in the know! I'm just the go-between. And if that's all you need, then beat it. I need some#br#
 time alone with my dough." You see Marvin kneading a stack of cash between his fingers. #M812010s100+30$Marvin$831$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Lelouch? I wonder how his excellency would know a story like that! Feels a bit weird#br# to disturb him about something stupid like this, but... well..." %p% shrugs. You shrug#br#
 in return. Sometimes you've gotta do what you've gotta do.#pets100+30$%p%$831$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You just hope you'll actually be able to decipher what he's SAYING...#char$$806$$0$0#|
11532|#&7$Marvin##br#
 One glance at Marvin confirms that he's already plunged deep within his#br#money-lined fantasies... #M812010s100+30$Marvin$824$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Probably best not to bother him further. Instead, go find that #&46$prince#! #char$$2$$0$0#|
11533|#&7$Lelouch##br#
"Newborn stars breaketh the night sky's hush#br#

#&7$%p%##br#
"It seems his majesty has been expecting us! Do forgive us the intrusion, my liege."#br#
 %p% bows respectfully, and once again, you're completely baffled as to how your#br# short-statured companion could have gathered that from the gibberish presented.
 #pets100+30$%p%$822$$0$0#

#&7$Lelouch##br#
"Like an emerald dream doest the light linger#br#
     Scales erupting from the new dawn's fingers#br#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Understood, my liege."#br#
 %p% bows again—this time, even lower.#pets100+30$%p%$822$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Still in the dark—as usual—you stage whisper to %p% asking what exactly#br#they'd just "understood."#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"It seems his majesty knows why we're here. Apparently, he had a dream recently#br#

 the ocean to a whole 'nother WORLD! A world of dragons!"
 #pets100+30$%p%$831$$1$0#

#&7$Lelouch##br#
"The morning crow doth take to the sky#br#
     Upon the horizon, new guests doest it spy#br#

 Lelouch's latest lyrical masterpiece is interrupted by a shout from behind you. #M806010s100+30$Lelouch$1$$1$0#|
11540|Corpses?! Sounds like a bad omen if you've ever seen one! Something is DEFINITELY not right about this picture.

Hurry after Agatha and figure out just where these dragons came from... and how they died.|
11541|#&7$Agatha##br#
"%n%! Where in God's name have you BEEN? I've been searching up and down#br# this entire godforsaken city for almost FIVE MINUTES, and that's FIVE MINUTES#br# too long! Something's happened in the bay, and we're needed there pronto!"
   #M320091$Agatha$301$$1$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"Seems a bunch of dragon corpses were found down by the water. No one knows#br#
 where they're from! If that's not a cause for alarm, I don't know WHAT is, so let's#br#
 figure out where these dead dragos came from and quick-like!" Agatha barely#br# pauses long enough to relay the situation before dashing off again.
   #M320091$Agatha$301$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Dragon corpses? In the bay?! Unfortunately, this takes precedence over some book,#br#
 so it looks like your current investigation will have to be put on hold.#char$$301$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
 %p%'s little head jerks from left to right and back again, then they bow one last#br#time to Lelouch before racing after you and Agatha.#pets100+30$%p%$303$$0$0#

#&7$Lelouch##br#
"Gift in handeth, they ascend the peak#br#
     Prayers for the godless, their outlooks bleak#br#

11542|#&7$Delphia##br#
"%n%! Something's happened in Crescent Bay! Agatha's already left to investigate,#br#
 but we could use more men on the job. You're to meet her there as soon as you can!"#br#
 Delphia's normally calm tone is laced with acerbity. #M327090$Delphia$2$$1$0#|
11543|#&7$Agatha##br#
"Delphia, quick! I've got a man down! This girl needs immediate medical attention."#br# Agatha runs ahead to nab Delphia's attention as you lag behind, the injured dragon-#br# turned-girl comatose on your back. You're not at all perturbed by the lack of help#br#
 you've been offered. #M320090$Agatha$301$$0$0#

#&7$Delphia##br#
"Goodness gracious! Quickly, set her down here. I'll immediately begin administering#br#
 a spell." You do as you're told, then watch as Delphia begins a soft incantation under#br#her breath, warm light radiating from her palms. #M327090$Delphia$2$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 When it appears that she's finished, you ask if she's going to be all right. Sometimes#br#you can never tell with these things, after all...#char$$821$$0$0#

#&7$Delphia##br#
"She appears to be in stable condition for now, but... who on earth IS she? These horns...#br#
 and these wings! Where did you find her? Weren't the two of you investigating the#br#
 corpses in Crescent Bay?" Delphia's features darken as she gently brushes the mysterious#br#girl's clumpy bangs from her forehead. #M327090$Delphia$4$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You nod, then begin your—somewhat overzealous—account of what transpired in the bay.#br#
 You make sure to mention how terrifying the whole ordeal was, and how grueling it was#br#lugging the girl's body all the way back to the nest.#char$$821$$0$0#

#&7$Delphia##br#
"My... my God, this-...!" Delphia shakes her head, closing and reopening her eyes as she#br#
 absorbs what you've told her. "I know this may sound fantastical, ABSURD, even, but-...#br#it's almost as if she's #&46$one of the dragons from the Enchanted Drachmar Chronicles#!" #M327090$Delphia$823$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Something clicks in the mechanical cogs of your brain, and you're instantly reminded#br#
 of your task to find that book's author. You quickly relay the results of your interviews#br#with the Hoppalongs, as well as the fact that the story stemmed from one of Lelouch's#br#dreams...#char$$2$$0$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"Lelouch? That drivel-spouting royal nutjob?" Agatha lets out a saliva-coated twang from#br#
 between her lips that sounds mildly similar to human flatulence. "Though... he's JUST weird#br#
 enough that it does make you wonder. Maybe there's some reason for all his inanity—and#br#maybe this crazy dragon kingdom really DOES exist." #M320090$Agatha$4$$1$0#|
11544|Follow the girl|
11550|How could the government have learned of the dragon girl so quickly?! Why, you've barely been back in the nest for an hour!

Whatever the case may be, they seem intent on taking custody of the poor girl. Something about the portly gentleman, though, rubs you the wrong way. Just as tempers are beginning to flare, the girl herself rises to her feet...|
11551|#&7$%n%##br#
 Almost as soon as Agatha's finished speaking, you hear the heavy clunk of footsteps from#br#behind you. The three of you spin around at the approach of someone decidedly unfamiliar...#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"Just what we need—the government getting involved. If THEY'VE caught wind of this#br#
 already, it can only mean bad things for us!" Agatha takes a step backwards, muttering#br#
 under her breath. #M320090$Agatha$1$$0$0#

#&7$Government Official##br#
"Good day to you, citizens. Agatha, Delphia, it's wonderful to see you again.#br#
 It's always SUCH a pleasure paying a visit to this side of the continent."#br#
 The official bows respectfully, but you can't help but wonder if there isn't#br#
 a twinge of sarcasm hidden beneath his words... #M401060$Government Official$822$$1$0#

#&7$Government Official##br#
"It seems you've been up to all sorts of things these past few days, yes? Rumor has it#br#
 you've brought back some sort of dragon girl from the bay area! Ah, pardon me.#br#Perhaps I should have used the word '#&46$caught#,' yes? And what a catch!" The man#br#laughs heartily to himself, belly jiggling with each guffaw. #M401060$Government Official$824$$1$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"And just what is THAT supposed to mean, huh?!"#br#
 Agatha jerks forward, eyes blazing, but Delphia quickly moves to stand between the two. #M320090$Agatha$101$$0$0#

#&7$Delphia##br#
"We thank you most graciously for the visit, sir, but please let the other council#br# members know that we're doing everything in our power to ensure the girl makes#br# a full recovery. She's suffered grave injuries and is currently resting, so we ask#br#
 that all visitations be postponed until a later date." #M327090$Delphia$1$$0$0#

#&7$Government Official##br#
"Now, you know as well as I do that I simply can't do that, my dear Delphia.#br#
 I have strict orders from the upper council to take custody of any and all #&46$rare##br# #&46$species# discovered in this region, and, well... that dragon girl you've nabbed#br# yourself is about as rare as they come. I ask for your cooperation in this matter."
   #M401060$Government Official$4$$1$0#

#&7$Delphia##br#
"We'll be more than happy to cooperate with you, sir, ONCE the girl has recovered.#br#
 It would put her at too much risk to be moved at this point in time. Once again, I'll#br#
 have to ask you to return at a later date. THEN we may discuss the girl's custody."#br#
 The icy astringence peppering Delphia's words sets your thoughts on edge. #M327090$Delphia$1$$0$0#

#&7$Drakeling Girl##br#
"I-... I'm fine... truly..."#br#
 The girl in question gets to her feet shakily, one hand raised to support her head. #M351010$Drakeling Girl$501$$1$0#|
11552|#&7$Delphia##br#
"Good heavens! You mustn't stand yet! Your wounds have yet to fully heal!" #M327090$Delphia$823$$1$0#

#&7$Drakeling Girl##br#
"I thank you for everything you've done. It was Delphia, wasn't it?#br# You have my utmost gratitude, and I owe you my life." The girl bows#br#
 her head long and low to Delphia, whom—cautiously, at first—returns#br#the sentiments with trembling pupils. #M350010$Drakeling Girl$822$$0$0#|
11553|#&7$Drakeling Girl##br#
"I have heard everything that's been said. Allow me to introduce myself—I am #&46$Oriel#,#br#

 are Agatha and %n%, two of my colleagues." #M327090$Delphia$822$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You take a hesitant step forward and bow your head, not quite sure how to behave#br#in the presence of royalty (and DRAGON royalty, no less!).#char$$822$$0$0#

#&7$Oriel##br#
"Agatha, %n%, and the rest of the Falcons—I cannot thank you enough. I owe each#br#
 and every one of you my life. I've still much to do, however, and I must continue my#br# mission. I must be taken to the leader of this kingdom at once. I trust a government#br#
 official will be able to take me there?" Oriel turns her eyes towards the man in question. #M351010$Oriel$4$$1$0#

#&7$Government Official##br#
"Me? I mean, well, heheh, of course! I would be MORE than happy to do as such,#br#
 my liege. And I do hope you'll forgive me for my, erm, transgressions earlier, as it#br#
 were. Right this way—right this way!" The man bows in humbled reverence, but#br#
 you detect the inklings of a smirk aimed in your direction as he regains his posture. #M401060$Government Official$822$$0$0#

#&7$Oriel##br#
"Thank you most kindly. Please, lead the way. And as for you, my dear Falcons, I#br#
 thank you once again and bid you farewell. Perhaps we shall see each other again."#br#
 Oriel nods her head, then flaps her wings once, twice, and floats after the official. #M351010$Oriel$822$$1$0#|
11560|Seems Garth is always up to one thing or another, and this time he's decided to tackle airships—and he needs YOUR help!

While part of you wishes people wouldn't assume you'd just help them out with every little whim they may or may not have, another part really wants to see what these airships are all about, so you agree to head to the Wraithwood and hunt Pebblepins to get some Sturdy Turtle Shells.|
11561|#&7$Delphia##br#
"Well, I-... I mean... this is-..." Delphia seems more than a bit frazzled, and it takes her#br#
 a moment of hand-wringing before she appears to remember something and come to.#br# "Right! %n%! I was supposed to give you this—a list of materials from Garth."#br#She pulls out a torn sheet of yellowed grid paper. #M327090$Delphia$826$$1$0#

#&7$Delphia##br#
"Seems he's suddenly been bit by the #&46$airship-renovation bug# and has decided to try#br#

 to you while pushing a still-disheveled lock of hair behind her ear. #M327090$Delphia$821$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 A bit taken aback, you run your eyes over the list. "Airship renovation?" Sounds just#br#
 intriguing enough that you don't find yourself affronted by the assumption you'd help#br#
 him out, no questions asked. The paper lists #&46$Sturdy Turtle Shells# as being top priority, so#br#it looks like you'll need to head over to the #&46$Wraithwood# and hunt some #&46$Pebblepins#!#char$$826$$0$0#|

 all over the cobblestones with a breathless sigh of relief. When you look up, however,#br#you notice that Garth is in a rather intense discussion with Van Pelt.#char$$351$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 The two of them jerk in surprise at the cacophony of eight giant shells clinking and#br#clanking and clattering all over the place and immediately halt their conversation. #br#You sheepishly scratch the back of your head before waving your hand in greetings.#char$$801$$0$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"Quite the entrance there, %n%! Didn't know you had such an interest in... chelonian#br#
 chassis collecting." Pelt raises an eyebrow at the still-spinning shells. "At any rate—Garth!#br#
 I'll leave you to it, yes? Have a few things of my own to take care of and what-not. I'll#br#
 catch the two of you later." Pelt shoots you a twirly salute and struts off, all business.
   #M330090$Van Pelt$4$$1$0#|
11570|Seems Sturdy Turtle Shells just aren't what they used to be—Garth doesn't think they'll be durable enough for his airship renovations.

Instead, he'd like you to find him some Celloshells from the Icecrystal Snappers in the Frostbite Forest. You only hope THESE shells'll be up to snuff...|
11571|#&7$Garth##br#
"Shells... SHELLS!" Garth immediately trots over to the amassment of shells and begins#br#
 snatching them up, pulling down the dual-magnifying lens from his goggles to more#br#
 closely examine the quality and pattern of each colossal carapace. You can't help but#br#notice how closely he resembles a kid in a candy store... #M329090$Garth$2$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 As Garth is hopping about from one shell to the next, you take the opportunity to turn#br#to Fate and inquire as to the source of Garth's sudden interest in airship renovation.#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Fate##br#
"His majesty... the prince... said that..." You wait patiently for Fate to finish her sentence,#br#
 but before she can muster the remaining words, Garth abruptly stands up with a#br#disgruntled sigh. #M808010s100+30$Fate$4$$1$0#

#&7$Garth##br#
"Aw, lugnuts! I really hate to do this to ya, Sprocket, but... well, let's just say these shells#br#
 aren't QUITE the quality I'd hoped they would be. Guess those Pebblepins aren't what#br# they used to be! Was hoping for something a bit more durable." Garth's eye blinks at#br#
 you at 12x the magnification as he dusts his hands off with a click of his tongue. #M329090$Garth$827$$1$0#

#&7$Garth##br#
"I'm gonna need somethin' tougher! Somethin' built to last! So I'm gonna have to ask you#br#
 another favor—you don't mind a bit more shell huntin', do ya? I need some #&46$Celloshells##br# this time. You can get 'em from the #&46$Icecrystal Snappers# in the #&46$Frostbite Forest#." Garth nods#br#
 his head in the general direction of said forest. #M329090$Garth$4$$1$0#|
11572|#&7$Garth##br#
"Let's see... the multi-piston engine should be good to go, got the steam cores installed,#br#
 fresh new plating in the engine room..." Garth ticks things off one by one on his fingers.#br# 
 "I hate to rush things, but after seeing Fate's face... #&46$whatever it was Lelouch told her##br#
 must have been serious!" #M329090$Garth$4$$1$0#|
11573|#&7$Garth##br#
"You're back! So quick! Knew I could count on you. Now, c'mon–let me see the shells,#br# the SHELLS!" Garth practically rips the bag from your back, and the Celloshells go#br#
 rumbling and tumbling about the cobblestones. Unfazed, he jumps from one shell to#br#the next in acute observation, humming beneath his breath. #M329090$Garth$4$$1$0#

#&7$Garth##br#
"Perfect... perfect!" A surly smile forms on Garth's lips, and he gives the shell he's holding#br#
 an almost musical rap with his knuckles. "By compounding the durability of these shells#br#
 with the size and weight of those turtle shells, I should have JUST the material I need for#br#
 the airship hull. You've done me well, Sprocket. Not that I should have expected any less, eh?"
   #M329090$Garth$824$54$1$0#|
11580|Garth's just about finished his airship renovations when the two of you are denied celebration by a sudden summons to the nest—seems like Pelt has something to announce! And you've a hunch Garth knows something about it.

At any rate, go report to Delphia back in the Falcon's Nest and wait for the big news...|
11581|#&7$Garth##br#
"Fate, my main gal, how's it goin' up there?" Garth cups a hand around his mouth#br#and shouts up at Fate in the airship's engine room. #M329090$Garth$827$$1$0#

#&7$Fate##br#
"Ship-shape... boss..."#br#
 You see Fate's ears dangle down from the open trap door. #M808010s100+30$Fate$826$$0$0#

#&7$Garth##br#
"Yeehaw! Design is a check! Structure's a check! We're well on our way to a rootin'#br# tootin', steam-spewin' piece of A+ airship finery, if I do say so myself! I've gotta hand#br#
 it to you fine people for helpin' out a guy in need. Thanks much, gents. Thanks much."#br#
 Garth claps his hands together with an only-slightly grease-speckled smile. #M329090$Garth$821$51$1$0#

#&7$Falcon Cadet##br#
"Garth! %n%! What are the two of you still doing here?!" You and Garth turn with#br#
 identical gloppened jerks at the sharp voice from behind you to see one of your fellow#br#Falcons jogging past, mildly out of breath. #M317090$Falcon Cadet$351$$0$0#

#&7$Falcon Cadet##br#
"Van Pelt just rallied everyone to the nest! He has #&46$some big announcement# to make and#br#
 wants every Falcon present and accounted for! Sounds pretty urgent, so I'd get over there#br#
 quick if I were the two of you!" The cadet smooths down the front of his uniform before#br#remembering to add a quick salute and "sirs" to the end of his message. #M317090$Falcon Cadet$4$$0$0#

#&7$Garth##br#
"Understood! We'll head over there ASAP. You make sure everyone else has caught#br# wind of the news?" Garth returns the salute with an authoritative nod of his head.
   #M329090$Garth$822$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 The cadet responds with a "yes, sir!" before jogging off, and you turn towards Garth#br#to see if—perhaps—he has any idea what this is all about.#char$$4$$822$0#

#&7$Garth##br#
"Welp. Seems like Pelt's made up his mind after all. C'mon, Sprocket—we should get over#br#
 there, yeah? And don't worry, you'll know what's going on soon enough. Pelt'll explain it#br#better than I could, anyhow." #M329090$Garth$821$$1$0#|
11582|#&7$Delphia##br#
"Ah, excellent. You two are here." #M327090$Delphia$2$$1$0#|
11583|#&7$%n%##br#
 You and Garth trudge up the steps to the nest to find most of your Falcon colleagues#br#
 already assembled and mingling about the environs. There's a bit of chatter between#br#some of the skittish recruits, but for the most part, the area is silent.#char$1$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 The wait isn't long. You've not been standing more than five minutes when Pelt makes#br#his way out of the nearby building... together with a surprising plus-one—Oriel! #M330090$Van Pelt$351$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 The gasps and cries of shock that ripple through the assembled Falcons come as no#br#
 surprise—after all, a girl with horns and wings just appeared before them!—but Bain#br#and Delphia do their best to calm the unrest before it turns into an uproar. #M330090$Van Pelt$1$$1$0#

#&7$Bain##br#
"C'mon, people. Let's keep things civil..."   #M310090$Bane$821$$1$0#

#&7$Delphia##br#
"Quiet, please! We need to have it quiet! Van Pelt has something he'd like to announce!" #M327090$Delphia$4$$1$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"My fellow Falcons!" Pelt holds out his arms, waiting for the crowd to quiet down enough#br#
 that his voice can be heard. "I know a lot of you may be at a loss for words right now, and#br#
 still others may have too MANY words, but I'm here today to talk about something which'll#br#likely surprise you even more—I've begun planning a #&46$Falcon expedition to Drachmar#." #M330090$Van Pelt$4$$1$0#|
11590|An agreement? Between Oriel and the central government? That part alone is surprising enough, but to hear that it also pertains to the Falcons?

You wonder to yourself just what this could entail as Pelt continues talking... |
11591|#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"Now, now, now..." Pelt waves his hands again as the crowd begins clamoring. "First#br#
 things first, I'd like to introduce the person behind me. This is Princess Oriel of the Fire#br#
 Dragon Kingdom. She's traveled far and wide to be with us here today from—as you've#br#
 probably already guessed—Drachmar. I know, right? Kinda unbelievable..." #M330090$Van Pelt$4$$1$0#

#&7$Oriel##br#
 Oriel spreads her wings and offers the assemblage a graceful bow. #M351010$Oriel$822$$1$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"I mean, really! I know a lot of you have probably read the Enchanted Drachmar#br#
 Chronicles, right? I know I have! The mystery... the adventure! Dragons that can#br#turn into people! And now to find out all that actually exists?!" Pelt's aura of authority#br#breaks as he lets out a hearty guffaw. #M330090$Van Pelt$1$$1$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"Erm, I mean..." He quickly coughs into his hand, recomposing himself. "Yes, yes,#br#
 it's all very shocking, but we should try and keep our heads about us! After all, an#br#agreement has been made between Oriel and the central government—and this#br#agreement concerns us, too!" #M330090$Van Pelt$1$$1$0#|
11592|#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"The agreement is as follows..." #M330090$Van Pelt$1$$1$0#|
11593|#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"So there you have it." Van Pelt scans his eyes across the crowd. "This ain't gonna be#br#
 a vacation—I can assure you of that! Drachmar, mystical as it sounds, is still an unknown#br#
 land. The risk involved in this venture will be great, that's why I'm not assigning this#br#
 task to anyone myself. If you'd like to take part, I want you to come to me personally."
   #M330090$Van Pelt$1$$1$0#|
11600|There's no way you'd miss the trip of a lifetime! You hurry over to Pelt and find your fellow Falcon elite ready and waiting to sign up with you.

Once you're ready to head out, find Rydia to board the airship and take off! Be sure you're ready, though—who knows WHAT'LL be waiting for you on that continent across the sea...|
11601|#&7$%n%##br#
 Drachmar? You bet your BOOTY you'll be on that expedition! This is the type of adventure#br#
 you've been waiting for! You quickly skirt your way over to where a line is forming in#br#front of Pelt, and—as expected—you see a number of familiar faces also anxious#br#to take part.#char$$2$$0$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"Shoulda figured you'd be champing at the bit on this one, %n%. Your interest has#br#
 been duly noted, and I'd be happy to have you as part of my vanguard team. For now,#br#
 though, go rest those gams of yours, yeah? We'll be needing all the strength you can#br#
 muster once we get this show on the road." Pelt gives you a solid clap on the back. #M330090$Van Pelt$4$$1$0#

#&7$Delphia##br#
"All the people I expected to see are here, it seems."#br#
 Delphia steps forward to solidify her own placement on the team with a smile. #M327090$Delphia$351$51$1$0#

#&7$Garth##br#
"The Enterprise is good to go! All renovations are complete, and she's as sturdy as a#br#
 redwood! Say the word and we can get everyone on board and take off! I put Rydia#br#in charge of the onboarding process, so to speak." Garth chuckles as he readjusts his goggles. #M329090$Garth$4$$1$0#|
11602|#&7$Oriel##br#
"I thank you, friends, for all of your help."#br#
  Oriel spreads her wings and offers your group a humbled bow. #M351010$Oriel$2$$1$0#|
11603|#&7$Oriel##br#
"I apologize for the slightly... rocky start this has been to our travels. I do hope this#br#
 hasn't dampened your view of my kingdom. Now that we're on solid ground, I'd like#br#
 to formally welcome you to one of our grandest colonies—the #&46$Broilt Charlands#.#br#
 As you can see it's... fairly resemblant of its name." You spy a tiny smile on Oriel's lips. #M351010$Oriel$822$$1$0#|
11604|#&7$Rydia##br#
"Is everyone here? Perfect! The airship is loaded and ready to go!#br#
 Welcome on board! And watch your step!" #npc$$4$$1$0#|
11605|Take off for Drachmar|
11607|I’m ready to go to Drachmar.|
11610|Just as Oriel's about to give you the grand tour, you're torn from the pleasantries by a gang of unruly Shadow Dragon assassins! The nerve!

Work together with your Copperhead allies to assassinate the assassins before they assassinate you!|
11611|#&7$Oriel##br#
 Just as Oriel begins going into detail about the beauty and wonder of the surrounding#br#
 char and soot, a rustling most fierce from the nearby twig-like bushes nabs your attention.#br#A sharp cry shatters the tour, followed by two, then three, and then—in a whirlwind-like#br#flurry—you're surrounded by a posse of black, shadowy figures! #M351010$Oriel$821$$1$0#

#&7$Oriel##br#
"Th-that emblem! The #&46$Shadow Dragon Army#?! Everyone, watch out!#br# #&46$Shadow Cabal# emblem...#br#
   #M351010$Oriel$101$$1$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"Ready your weapons, gents! Looks like we're getting a warm welcome, after all!"   #M330091$Van Pelt$101$$1$0#|
11612|#&7$Oriel##br#
"The Shadow Cabal's assassins... It hasn't been more than a few days since I left..."
   #M351010$Oriel$821$$1$0#|
11613|#&7$Katya##br#
"..."#br#
 You glance over to see Katya eyeing the retreating enemies' backs, a strange,#br#unreadable expression gracing her features. #M043080$Katya$1$$1$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"Everyone still in one piece? Call out if you're dead!" Pelt chuckles to himself until he#br#
 spies the rest of the group sending him expressions of astute unamusement. He coughs#br#into his hand. "Anyway, c'mon. Let's regroup. Reassess the situation and all that." #M330090$Van Pelt$821$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You think back to the fight. Portions of it replay again and again in your mind. They'd#br#been so strong! If they'd brought a few more... you shudder to think what would have#br#become of your group. Seems those dragon people really pack a punch... or two!#char$$826$$0$0#

#&7$Katya##br#
"With all due respect, Pelt, I think it's about time my people and yours part ways. Let's#br#
 just say we... rely on different 'methods' than you Falcons. We'd both make more progress#br#
 If we weren't bumping heads constantly." Katya nods back to her men with a sharp jerk#br#of her neck. "But I'm sure we'll see each other again all too soon..." #M043080$Katya$821$$0$0#|
11620|Poor Oriel is thrown a curve ball when Katya and the other Copperheads abruptly pack their things and go. Pelt, on the other hand, isn't surprised one bit. The shaky Copperhead-Falcon alliance is about as solid as a two-ton pile of tissue paper, after all...|
11621|#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"But-... you-... I mean-..." Pelt's surly features transition from surprised to confused to#br#
 irate. Once Katya and her crew are out of earshot, he gives his nose an overzealous#br#scratch and promptly spits on the ground. "...typical." #M330090$Van Pelt$1$$1$0#

#&7$Oriel##br#
"They're just going to leave? Like that...?" Oriel seems equally as flummoxed, her soft#br#
 eyes gazing off in the direction the Copperheads had left. "But I thought..." #M351010$Oriel$823$$0$0#

#&7$Oriel##br#
"...I thought that we were all going to work together." Her eyebrows form downward#br# sloping arcs so steep you're worried they're liable to slide right off her face. Casting#br#
 her gaze away from the retreating Copperheads, she turns towards Pelt for an answer. #M351010$Oriel$821$$0$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"Once a two-timing, conceited troupe of pricks, ALWAYS a two-timing, conceited#br#
 troupe of pricks. Sorry, Princess, but it seems our posse's been dichotomized. You'll#br#have to rely on us for now." Pelt throws Oriel an apologetic look. #M330090$Van Pelt$822$$1$0#|
11622|#&7$Oriel##br#
"Perhaps I've been too naïve. I never thought this would be easy, but I'd wanted to#br#
 believe that... that..." You see the corners of Oriel's eyes tighten, and she shakes her#br#head. "I just hope I've done the right thing..." #M351010$Oriel$821$$1$0#|
11623|#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"The Falcons and the Copperheads have NEVER seen eye to eye. They actually cavort#br#
 with those pompous blockheads that call themselves a government. We Falcons, on the#br#
 other hand, are nothing but a thorn in the government's side. Unfortunately, that means#br#
 we can't do anything to stop them now. Who knows—maybe they have divergent orders..."  
   #M330090$Van Pelt$826$$0$0#|
11630|Despite her misgivings about the matter, Oriel decides to proceed with or without the Copperheads and lead you to the citadel of her people—a mighty fortress hidden deep within the mountains!

As you're decidedly airship-less, however, you'll need a different method of transportation... one with wings! Go find this "Drogelire," the flying dragon, within Haven's Cadence to the north, but keep an eye out for Shadow Dragon troopers behind every corner...
|
11631|#&7$Oriel##br#
"I see. I was unaware of the situation between your two orders. It would seem your#br#
 society has its own fair share of troubles." You see Oriel's wings visibly droop. "As#br#
 you said, though, there's nothing more to be done. I will take you to my citadel.#br#
 Normally, we'd have to fly..." She glances skeptically towards the smoking airship.  
 #M351010$Oriel$821$$1$0#

#&7$Garth##br#
"You guys go on ahead! I'll stay with the Enterprise and get her fixed up. Don't#br# worry—she'll be as right as rain in no time flat!" Garth pats the hull of the airship#br#
 with an undaunted nod of his head. #M329090$$821$$1$0#

#&7$Oriel##br#
The tiniest of smile returns to Oriel's face at his churlish optimism. "All right, then. The#br# fortress is deep within the mountains, so we'll need to find #&46$Drogelire#. He'll be able to#br# carry you across the sierra. We should head north towards #&46$Haven's Cadence#, but be#br#warned... I have a feeling the Shadow Dragon Army will not make things easy for us."
  
 #M351010$Oriel$821$$1$0#|
11632|#&7$Oriel##br#
"There it is! Just beyond that ridge!" #M351010$Oriel$351$$1$0#|
11633|#&7$%n%##br#
 You find yourself considerably short of breath as the landscape below unfolds before#br#your very eyes. It's nothing short of magnificent!#char$$823$$0$0#

#&7$Oriel##br#
"Welcome to the pride and glory of my people—the #&46$Volcazar#. It is the grandest citadel#br#
 in all of Drachmar, and the most strategically positioned, as well!" Oriel shoots you a#br#wink that brings the slightest tinge of pink to your cheeks. #M351010$Oriel$822$$1$0#

|
11640|The going isn't easy, but you finally make it—your final destination and most esteemed citadel of the Fire Dragon Kingdom, the Volcazar. Needless to say, it's a sight to behold.

Unfortunately, you've no time yet for sightseeing! You're wanted at the altar pronto for an audience with the Holy Dragon Queen!|
11641|#&7$Oriel##br#
"I can only assume you're anxious to see everything our great fortress has to offer, but#br#
 time is currently of the essence. I must ask you to proceed immediately to the #&46$altar# for#br#an audience with the #&46$Holy Dragon Queen#. She'll likely have sensed your arrival#br#and will want to speak with you posthaste!" #M351010$Oriel$821$$1$0#|
11642|#&7$%n%##br#
 Oriel's demeanor changes almost instantly upon the woman's arrival. #M351010$Oriel$2$$1$0#|
11643|#&7$Oriel##br#
"E-Esh-Baal!"#br#
 You see Oriel sputter, her wings instinctively folding in on themselves. #M351010$Oriel$822$56$1$0#

#&7$Ashar##br#
"I had a feeling you were going to make your presence known..."#M353010$Ashar$4$$1$0#|
11644|#&7$Agatha##br#
"Y-you're the... you're the... from back in the bay!" #M320090$Agatha$823$53$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Your eyes practically bug out of their sockets. I-it couldn't possibly be! ...could it?#char$$823$53$0$0#

#&7$Holy Dragon Queen##br#
"Greetings, my friends, and welcome to the Fire Dragon Kingdom. It's been some#br# time since I've seen you two, has it not?" The golden goddess hovering in front of you#br#
 smiles in mirth before bowing her head in yours and Agatha's direction. You can't help#br#but feel it should be YOU bowing, instead... #M353010$Holy Dragon Queen$822$51$1$0#

#&7$Holy Dragon Queen##br#
"I am called #&46$Ashar#, the Holy Dragon Queen of Drachmar. My gratitude knows#br#
 no bounds for what you have done. At the same time, I must offer my apologies, for I#br#
 know the task I've placed before you is not an easy one. I only wish that our plight need#br#
 not involve outsiders such as yourselves..." You see Ashar's eyes visibly strain. #M353010$Holy Dragon Queen$822$$1$0#

#&7$Ashar##br#
"By now, you know the reason I've requested your presence. Long, long ago, my very#br#
 own sister, near and dear as she was, succumbed to the powers of enmity. She lost#br#
 herself to the very shadow she'd been born unto, and with it, was driven to madness.#br#My sister #&46$Zilthai, the Shadow Dragon Queen#..." #M353010$Ashar$821$$1$0#

#&7$Ashar##br#
Ashar's gaze turns towards the sky. "...I couldn't do it. I could not bear to take my own#br#
 sister's life, but we all knew that the Zilthai we'd known was no more. We could not let#br#
 her destroy this kingdom. Thus, we decided to seal her away. Imprison her deep within#br#this very mountain where she could do no harm." #M353010$Ashar$4$$1$0#

#&7$Ashar##br#
"It did not come without a price..." Ashar's eyes close for a moment, her voice trembling.#br#
 "Not even the power of the four Dragon Queens combined could keep my sister's rage#br#
 contained, and, in the end, I was forced to sacrifice my own body to forge the seal." #M353010$Ashar$1$$1$0#

#&7$Ashar##br#
"The form you see before you now is nothing but a spirit. A shadow, if you will, of my#br#
 former self. I took this form in order to guide Oriel to the Central Continent and find you,#br#my dear friends..." #M353010$Ashar$4$$1$0#

#&7$Ashar##br#
 Ashar looks from you to Agatha, then back to you. A smile forms on her face, and for just#br#one instant, you feel as though she's trying to tell you something. #M353010$Holy Dragon Queen$822$51$1$0#

#&7$Ashar##br#
"And just WHY is it humans are needed to break the seal, oh, VENERABLE one?"#br#
 A stringent voice cuts into your conversation, and a drakeling goddess with eyes#br#
 of gold and hair like flowing magma descends into your circle. #M360010$Ginger Beauty$825$$1$0#|
11645|Meet with the Holy Dragon Queen|
11650|It seems not all are happy about your presence in the Volcazar. Esh-Baal, the Fire Dragon Queen, seems to have a bone to pick with you and your fellow "hornless," but just what effect will this have on you and your mission?|
11651|#&7$Oriel##br#
"Esh-Baal, I-..."#br#
 But once again, Oriel is cut-off almost as soon as she's started. #M351010$Oriel$821$$1$0#

#&7$Ginger Beauty##br#
"Dear little sister, what HAVE you done? You've brought humans to our most sacred#br#
 place! Do you have any idea what kind of breach in protocol this is?" The fiery redhead#br#
 unfolds her wings to their full breadth, one hand on her hip and the other pointing an#br#
 index finger between Oriel's eyes. #M360010$Ginger Beauty$825$$1$0#

#&7$Ginger Beauty##br#
"I'll not abide these... these HORNLESS in my kingdom! We don't need them! We've#br#
 NEVER needed them! The problems of drakelings are exactly that—the problems of#br#
 DRAKELINGS! And we don't need these warm-blooded, monkey-brained MAMMALS#br#
 tromping about our holy sanctuaries! Leave at once! Your kind isn't welcome here!" #M360010$Ginger Beauty$825$$1$0#

#&7$Ashar##br#
"Still your tongue, Esh-Baal! I will not have that kind of talk at my altar. It was I who#br# instructed Oriel to bring these humans here. They're our only hope of stopping the#br#
 Shadow Dragon Army before it's too late." #M353010$Ashar$821$$0$0#

#&7$Esh-Baal##br#
"Well, PARDON me, my lady. I didn't know we drakelings had regressed to the point#br#
 of needing hornless assistance! Here I thought we were a proud race. A strong race!#br# Or have you lost your faith in our kind, hm? Running to humans with our wings tucked#br#
 under our ASSES? HUMANS, my lady. Greedy, arrogant, conniving HUMANS!"
   #M350010$Esh-Baal$822$$1$0#

#&7$Oriel##br#
"Don't speak of them that way! They saved my life! And they've demonstrated nothing#br#
 but kindness and understanding, even when asked to perform such a daunting task!"#br#
 Oriel finally works up the courage to fight back against Esh-Baal's burgeoning ignominy.#M351010$Oriel$821$$0$0#

#&7$Oriel##br#
"Surely even YOU have realized the situation we're currently in. We can't let this go#br#
 any further! If we don't ask for outside help, we'll... we'll..."
   #M351010$Oriel$821$$0$0#|
11652|#&7$Oriel##br#
 Oriel is visibly upset, her wings drooping sadly with each up and down stroke. #M351010$Oriel$1$56$1$0#|
11653|#&7$Oriel##br#
"I apologize for my sister's behavior... You must believe me that she means the best.#br#
 She is our queen, after all, and under an enormous amount of pressure. I'm sure you#br#
 can all understand..." You can tell that even Oriel doesn't quite believe her own words. #M351010$Oriel$822$56$1$0#

#&7$Oriel##br#
"...that being said, as much as I wish to perish the very thought, without my sister's#br#
 approval, I fear for the success of our efforts. Only the #&46$current Dragon Queens# know#br#
 where the seal resides, and in her current state, I highly doubt she would relinquish#br#
 this information." Oriel's lips press together in a tight line, her brows furrowing.
   #M351010$Oriel$2$$1$0#|
11660|The Fire Dragon Queen seems like one fiery hot mama—in more ways than one! Oriel thinks the only way of cooling her rage might be finding their brother, Ashkenaz, and asking him to convince her of their situation's severity. The question, however, is just where Ashkenaz IS, and for that, it sounds like you'll need to inquire with his friend John.

Meet Oriel in the Broilt Charlands and get ready for some headhunting!|
11661|#&7$Oriel##br#
"...wait a minute! I may just have an idea. If there's anyone who can convince Esh-Baal,#br#
 it would be #&46$Ashkenaz#!" Oriel snaps her fingers together with an earnest swing of her arm.
   #M351010$Oriel$821$$1$0#

#&7$Oriel##br#
"Ashkenaz is our brother—quite different from the both of us... and a bit of a bookworm."#br#
 She giggles softly at this. "He's never been much of one for politics, so he took to the globe,#br#
 traveling around, visiting different worlds, meeting so many people..." She pauses. "I'm#br#
 not sure where he is now, however, but I just might know someone who does." #M351010$Oriel$821$$1$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"Seems like the best lead we've got! Let's find this person and see what we can see,#br#
 yeah? Bain, I'd like you, Agatha, Nash, Ukyo, Lenora, and %n% to go with her#br#
 royal highness and search for information on this Ashkenaz's whereabouts. I'll stay#br#
 here with the rest of the guild and attempt to... douse the fires, so to speak." #M330090$Van Pelt$4$$0$0#

#&7$Oriel##br#
"Excellent. I think that would be our best option at this point. A friend of my brother's#br# lives not too far from here—a human named #&46$John#. If we find him, he may be able to tell#br#
 us where my brother's run off to." You sense the confidence returning to Oriel's voice.#br#
 "Do watch out for my sister, though. I can't be sure what she might try and pull..." #M351010$Oriel$822$$1$0#|
11662|#&7$Oriel##br#
"Hmm... could it have been...? No. Or perhaps..."#br#
 Oriel is muttering something beneath her breath. #M351010$Oriel$1$$1$0#|
11663|#&7$Oriel##br#
"Hmm... could it have been...? No. Or perhaps..." You approach Oriel to find#br#
 her scanning the environs while muttering something beneath her breath. #M351010$Oriel$1$$1$0#

#&7$Bain##br#
"So, where can we find this John?" #M310090$Bain$821$$0$0#

#&7$Oriel##br#
"Oh! You're here! I-... I mean, it's... it's just that..." Oriel's wings flutter at what you#br# can only assume is the speed of her frantically beating heart. She wipes at a bead#br#
 of sweat dribbling down her temple before replying with a sheepish grin. "I just#br#realized I'm not quite sure where John lives..." #M351010$Oriel$1$53$1$0#|
11670|Surprise, surprise—it turns out Oriel actually has no idea where John lives! Only that he's SOMEwhere within the Broilt Charlands. This search party is turning into less and less of a "party" with each passing minute.

At any rate, you'll need to split up to cover more ground. Spread out across the charlands and find that John!|
11671|#&7$%n%##br#
 Wonderful. Just wonderful. You can't help but feel that this wild goose chase will only#br#continue to grow wilder the longer it's allowed to continue. You ask—scarcely contained#br#virulence laced between your words—why she hadn't thought to inform you of this earlier.#char$$826$56$0$0#

#&7$Oriel##br#
"I-... I do apologize. I just got so FLUSTERED with... with that whole encounter with#br# my sister, and then it all just seemed to happen so quickly, and I really didn't get the#br#
 chance to think things through!" Oriel's normally reposeful elocution takes off at a#br#
 rapid prestissimo. "But I DO know that he lives somewhere, well... HERE."
   #M351010$Oriel$822$56$1$0#

#&7$Bain##br#
"We should split up, then." #M310090$Bain$1$$0$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"Seems like we've got no choice—we'll be out here all night otherwise!#br#Oh, right. And %n%, try not to die?" #M320090$Agatha$821$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You assure Agatha that you'll do your best to keep all the protruding parts of your#br#body attached in their correct spots.#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Nash##br#
"Perhaps we could make a game of it, no? Would at least make things more interesting.#br#
 Of course, we all know I'll come out on top—I always do. The real question is who'll#br#end up on the BOTTOM..." Nash throws a somewhat questionable smirk in your direction.#br#You eloquently ignore it. #M322090$Nash$824$$1$0#

#&7$Lenora##br#
 Lenora glances over at Nash, her expression an unreadable enigma. #br##M324090$Lenora$1$$0$0#|
11672|#&7$Lenora##br#
You can tell even from a distance that Lenora is upset.

 Nash stands a few steps back, clearly at a loss as to what to do or say. #M322090$Nash$826$$0$0#|
11673|#&7$%n%##br#
 You feel like you've searched these blighted charlands so long, your lungs have turned#br#
 into giant dust bins, and there's STILL no sign of John! You can't help but feel mildly#br#
 discouraged until you spot #&46$Lenora and Nash# just ahead. Perhaps they've found something!#char$$801$51$0$0#

#&7$Nash##br#
"Hm? Ah, it's just you. I thought perhaps you were a rabid Rhinoroo what with that#br#triple-coating of dust cluttering your every pore." #M322090$Nash$4$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 As you so often do, you ignore the comment, and simply ask if the two of them have#br#found any clues as to John's whereabouts.#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Nash##br#
"Alas, not a one! It would seem this 'John' is quite the slippery sailor, indeed. But the#br# more pressing matter at hand, it would seem, is the little—hrm—HITCH we've developed in #br#
 the giddy-up, as it were..." Nash sidles up beside you, whispering tersely in your ear.#M322090$Nash$823$$1$0#|

11680|The Shadow Dragon Army upsetting the creatures in the Broilt Charlands has got Lenora feeling pressed. She longs to pacify the poor things to keep them from harming anyone else, but is at a loss as to how to do so.

Nash, however, has come up with what he believes to be a sensational plan. Despite your misgivings, you agree to go along with him... for now. He wants you to go bludgeon some of the nearby Rhinoroos and bring them back.|
11681|#&7$%n%##br#
 Confused as you are by the references to hitches and giddy-ups, you, too, can tell that#br#something is wrong with Lenora. You turn towards the softspoken lass and inquire as to#br#what's the matter.#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Lenora##br#
"Oh, %n%. I didn't even see you there." Lenora's eyes widen momentarily upon eyeing#br# you, and she takes the opportunity to reassess her surroundings. "Really, it's-... no,#br#everything's fine. Really..." #br##M324090$Lenora$821$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Unconvinced, you rephrase your question, this time asking if something in the charlands#br#might possibly, conceivably, potentially be causing her some sort of frustration.#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Lenora##br#
"Well, I-... yes. Yes, actually. Take a look around, %n%. Have you noticed? So many of#br# these animals are portraying aggressive tendencies, but I know it's not in their nature!#br#
 I believe it's due to the Shadow Dragon Army. These creatures, they... have taken to#br#
 attacking the army, but I fear they'll grow used to it and begin attacking others, as well..."
  #br##M324090$Lenora$827$$1$0#

#&7$Nash##br#
 You spy Nash off to the side, tapping a finger against his chin as though considering#br#something very carefully. Finally, in a bit of a flourish, he rushes to your side, yanks#br#your arm, and pulls you out of earshot. #M322090$Nash$301$$1$0#

#&7$Nash##br#
"I've done it! I've come up with the perfect plan to ease Lenora's mental anguish."#br#
 Practically giggling to himself in glee, he pulls you in close, one hand up to cup your#br#
 ear as he begins whispering fiercely. "First we'll... and then we'll... and THEN we'll..." #M322090$Nash$821$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Your eyes grow rounder and rounder as your disbelief grows, climaxing at the words#br#"bludgeon until unconscious"—a phrase you can't help but repeat out loud with a high-pitched squeak.#char$$823$53$0$0#

#&7$Nash##br#
"ShhhhhHHHHHHHHhhhhhh!" Nash immediately clamps his hand around your mouth,#br# and the two of you look to Lenora in order to ascertain her ignorance. Thankfully, it would#br#seem she hadn't been paying attention. #M322090$Nash$823$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You wrench Nash's palm from your lips and explain in minute detail just how bad#br#of a plan you believe his idea to be.#char$$826$$0$0#

#&7$Nash##br#
"Oh, piddle! It'll be perfectly fine. MORE than fine! All we need to do is make sure she#br# doesn't find out! It's as simple as that!" Nash gives your hair a thorough fluffing with#br#
 his hand, and you can't help but feel a bit patronized. #M322090$Nash$4$$1$0#|
11682|#&7$Nash##br#
"Well? Have you done it? Surely a simple task such as this couldn't take you QUITE#br#
 this long! Oh, I should have just done it myself! I could have finished it AEONS ago..." #M322090$Nash$4$$1$0#|
11683|#&7$%n%##br#
 The sack of unconscious Rhinoroos upon your back, you make your way surreptitiously#br#over to Nash and inform him of your successful venture.#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Nash##br#
"Brilliant! Marvelous! It only took you four times as long as it would have taken me, but#br#
 at least you were able to get the job done, yes? Now, then... watch and learn! It's time you#br#witnessed a true master at work." #M322090$Nash$824$$1$0#

#&7$Nash##br#
"Dearest Lenora, you need not worry yourself a single second longer for I have placated#br# the beasts myself! Observe their calm demeanor—their relaxed facades! I might even#br#
 venture to say these are the most placid beasts I've ever laid eyes upon!" Nash empties#br# the bag of Rhinoroos on the ground. They tumble over each other like limp, wet noodles.
   #M322090$Nash$824$$1$0#

#&7$Lenora##br#
 Lenora blinks in silence for a moment, her eyes taking in the scene before her. The#br# unconscious Rhinoroos lie cold and still in the dirt with their tongues hanging out.#br##M324090$Lenora$823$$0$0#

#&7$Lenora##br#
"Nash, you... you... YOU-!!"#br#
 Lenora's entire body begins to quiver with barely bridled rage. #br##M324090$Lenora$825$$0$0#

#&7$Nash##br#
"Wh-what's that face for? I-... I thought you would be pleased! Look at how... how...#br#
 how HAPPY they look!" Nash picks up one of the Rhinoroos and attempts to form#br#its sagging mouth into a smile. #M322090$Nash$823$53$1$0#|
11690|Nash's idea—to no one's surprise—has only infuriated Lenora to the point of a mental breakdown. You don't wanna say I told you so, but you DID tell him so.

At any rate, you have a feeling these two will need some time alone, so you decide to forge ahead and see if any of the other Falcons have found anything.|
11691|#&7$%n%##br#
 You're not at all surprised by Lenora's reaction—you could have foretold this#br#
 conclusion yourself! Unfortunately, it would appear some people NEVER learn.#br#Quietly, you ask Nash if you should perhaps bludgeon a few more helpless animals.#char$$1$$0$0#

#&7$Nash##br#
 Nash, however, is far too occupied with trying to calm Lenora down that he doesn't#br#
 even appreciate your sarcasm. With a shrug, you decide to leave the two to their own#br#devices and plow ahead—you've still a man to find, after all!#M322090$Nash$821$$1$0#|
11692|#&7$%n%##br#
 As you approach the nearby bluffs, your ears pick up the naggiest, haughtiest, most#br#
 vexatious voice you've ever heard fluttering by on the wind. Ah, right—Agatha.#br#You approach with caution.#char$$351$$0$0#|
11693|#&7$Agatha##br#
"I said I'm FINE, you big pompous pain in my great aunt's keister! I really don't#br# see what the big deal is here!" Agatha's voice seems to rattle the surrounding ruins.
   #M320090$Agatha$825$55$1$0#

#&7$Bain##br#
 Bain's normally expressionless features remain just that—expressionless. #M310090$Bain$1$$0$0#|
11700|Wonder of wonder, miracle of miracles—Bain and Agatha are arguing again! Sometimes you'd swear NO one in this order actually gets along.

The debate, however, is cut short when Bain senses something nearby. You'll need to go check it out before any kind of conclusion can be reached.|
11701|#&7$%n%##br#
 Curious as to just what's gotten under Agatha's skin this time—though not quite sure#br#you WANT to know—you venture forward with mild trepidation and inquire#br#as to what's happened.#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Bain##br#
"Agatha's injured herself. I ordered her to return to the Volcazar and await treatment." #M310090$Bain$1$$1$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"Mother of GOD! Are you not even listening to me?! I've had blood splurting from#br#
 between my eye sockets—something you'll be experiencing shortly, mind you—and#br#not had to 'return to base and await treatment.' You are the most aggravating#br#creature on this PLANET!" Agatha attempts to stand and abruptly loses her balance. #M320090$Agatha$3$$1$0#

#&7$Bain##br#
"Watch it."#br#
 Bain steps forward coolly and holds out a hand to support her. #M310090$Bain$1$$1$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"GET away from me. The last thing I need is help from YOU!"#br# Agatha slaps his hand away. You're fairly certain everyone back#br#
 in Elysium could have heard that slap. #M320090$Agatha$825$55$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Worried about the integrity of Bain's ulna, you inquire as to how Agatha injured herself.#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"I didn't 'injure' myself. I missed a tiny little hole in the ground and HAPPENED to trip.#br# That was all! And now my ankle's just a bit sore. But it's no reason to all get our panties#br#
 in a twist! I'm perfectly fine! Never felt better!" Agatha shoots another glare at Bain. #M320090$Agatha$821$$1$0#

#&7$Bain##br#
"..." Bain's eyes narrow into tiny slits, and his head jerks to the right. He pauses,#br#
 intently scrutinizes the surrounding landscape, then curses under his breath. #M310090$Bain$1$$1$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"What is i-..." Agatha stops mid-sentence, her own features hardening.#br#
 It seems whatever Bain had sensed, she'd just picked up on, as well. #M320090$Agatha$825$$1$0#

#&7$Bain##br#
"There's something out there. %n%, come with me." Bain takes off without another#br#
 word, and you quickly jog to catch up. #M310090$Bain$4$$1$0#|
11702|#&7$Bain##br#
"Have you found anything?"#M310090$Bain$1$$1$0#|
11703|#&7$%n%##br#
 You tell Bain that the Shadow Cabal's assassins are lying in wait up ahead.#br#
 ambush, and your near-death experience fighting off the assassins! You also mention#br#the plethora of footprints littering the sand.#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Bain##br#
"The Shadow Cabal is making its move." #M310090$Bain$1$$1$0#

#&7$Bain##br#
"I've got a bad feeling about this. Agatha—return to the Volcazar. %n%, come with#br#
 me." Bain walks a few paces off and runs a quick hand through his hair to remove#br#the sand buildup. #M310090$Bain$1$$1$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"Are you deaf AND suffering from short-term memory loss?! I'm NOT. GOING."#br# Agatha takes an enraged step towards Bain, the very ground shaking beneath#br#
 her boots. You feel your own soul shrivel up into a shivering ball of hopeless#br# despair and her anger isn't even directed at you!
   #M320090$Agatha$825$55$1$0#

#&7$Bain##br#
"THAT'S ENOUGH!!"#M310090$Bain$1$$1$0#

"H-... holy hell, Bain! Was that-... I mean-... did you really-... I didn't-..."#br#
 For the first time in your life, you see Agatha at a complete loss for words. #M320090$Agatha$823$$1$0#

#&7$Bain##br#
"Did you not hear what I said? This situation only looks to be getting worse. You need#br#
 to go back NOW so you'll be able to help us LATER." Bain emphasizes his words by#br#jerking his thumb first in the direction of the Volcazar and second in the direction of the#br#assassins' ambush. #M310090$Bain$1$$1$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"I-... well-... o-okay..." Agatha turns away, her lips pressed tightly together.  
   #M320090$Agatha$826$$1$0#

 Her palpable shame makes YOU feel ashamed. You've never seen Agatha like this#br#

Agatha, of course, never misses a thing you do. "%n%, get your head out of the#br# clouds! You realize what kind of situation we're in here?" She slaps the side of your#br#

"I should actually report all this to Van. I'll head back with Agatha first and rendezvous#br#with you and Ukyo later.

11740|Oriel supposes that John must have been referring to the Sealed Sanctuary—and that her brother, Ashkenaz, must be there!

Just as you're beginning to discuss what to do, however, she's overcome with a debilitating sense of urgency. Something's happened at the Volcazar, and you can't imagine it's anything good... |
11741|#&7$%n%##br#
 You further proceed to inform them of everything else that had happened before they'd#br#arrived—about the Copperheads and the Shadow Dragon Army, about Ashar's efforts#br#to hold them back.#char$$821$$0$0#

#&7$Oriel##br#
"I-it can't be! The Copperheads?! But why? Why would they join forces with the Shadow#br# Dragon Army?" Oriel's hands go to the sides of her head. All of this seems to be too much#br#
 for the Fire Dragon Princess. "None of this makes any sense!"
   #M351010$Oriel$823$$1$0#

#&7$Nash##br#
"Typical Copperhead folly, if you ask me. They've always been a conniving lot—why#br# should we have expected this time to be any different? Honor and integrity simply#br#
 aren't in their vocabulary!" Nash brushes his bangs from his eyes with a perturbed#br#
 swipe of his hand. #M322090$Nash$826$$1$0#

#&7$Oriel##br#
"My brother, though..." Oriel's eyes narrow, and you can see her chewing on the inside#br#
 of her cheek. "You're sure that John mentioned a 'sanctuary'?"
   #M351010$Oriel$1$$1$0#

#&7$Oriel##br#
"He must mean the Sealed Sanctuary! It's where the Shadow Dragon Queen has been#br#
 sealed for centuries. But... why would Ashkenaz be there? And... and how could he #br#
 even know where it is?" She shakes her head. "At any rate, we must inform my sister!#br#
 Nothing about this is adding up. I just hope we won't be too late... again!"
   #M351010$Oriel$826$$1$0#|
11742|#&7$Oriel##br#
"Something feels... wrong." All of a sudden, Oriel's eyes cloud. "The Volcazar!"
   #M351010$Oriel$1$$1$0#|
11743|#&7$Oriel##br#
"Stygian Peak..."#M351010$Oriel$1$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Just as you're wondering if this means the lot of you will be shoving off again, you#br#
 hear a clattering of armor and boots from behind you and turn to see Van Pelt coming#br#at you like a speeding bullet (which is impressive, actually, given the man's general#br#distaste for anything physical that doesn't involve whacking things with his axe). #M330091$Van Pelt$301$$1$0#|
11744|#&7$Pomelo##br#
"Your royal highness! You've returned!" The guard in front of you gives a long, low bow.
   #M310051$Pomelo$822$$1$0#

#&7$Oriel##br#
"Where is my si-... I mean, where is the queen? I must speak with her immediately!" #M351010$Oriel$821$$0$0#

#&7$Pomelo##br#
"Her Majesty, the Queen, has already departed! She and the rest of the army have#br#
 She has received information that the Shadow Cabal had discovered their location was planning an assault to break the seal." #M310051$Pomelo$822$$1$0#

#&7$Oriel##br#
"She's left for the sanctuary?! Did she happen to mention where it was?" Oriel's#br# eyes blaze with a ferocity you didn't know existed within her.
   #M351010$Oriel$821$$0$0#

#&7$Pomelo##br#
"She did, indeed, my liege! All remaining troops are to be on standby for deployment to#br##&46$Stygian Peak#!" Pomelo's voice relays the orders with crisp certainty. #M310051$Pomelo$822$$1$0#|
11745|Return to the Volcazar|
11750|Esh-Baal and the rest of the Fire Dragon Army have already departed for Stygian Peak! You'll need to make like a tree and get over there if you've any hope of making it there in time.

Van Pelt asks you and some of the others to grab your things and boogie—you've got an entire army to catch!|
11751|#&7$Oriel##br#
"If my sister has already left for the peak, then we haven't much time. We must#br#
 catch up with her at once! Oppose us all she wants—she'll need our help. If the#br#Copperheads and the Shadow Dragon Army are working together...!" #M351010$Oriel$821$$1$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"Looks like you've already heard the news. If you'd been here about an hour ago, you'd#br#
 have seen all hell breaking loose! I figured I'd stay here and wait for you, though." Pelt#br#
 runs a hand through his somewhat bedraggled hair. "Bain, I'd like you, Ukyo, Nash,#br#
 Lenora, and %n% to come with me to the peak. The rest—stay and guard the Volcazar." #M330090$Van Pelt$821$$0$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"PELT! If you think I'm just gonna sit here and—"
   #M320090$Agatha$825$$1$0#

#&7$Bain##br#
"With that injury, you'll only slow us down."#br#
 Bain barely even glances at Agatha as he readjusts his belt. #M310090$Bain$1$$0$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
Agatha looks from Pelt to Bain, then back to Pelt. Finally, her jaw clenched, she jerks#br#her head away with a sharp groan. "FINE. Fine. Whatever. See what I care." #M320090$Agatha$3$$1$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"Glad that got handled without any loss of blood, yeah? I'm pleasantly surprised!#br# At any rate, those coming with me need to grab their things and get ready to head#br#
 out. We need to burn rubber if we wanna make up for lost time." #M330090$Van Pelt$821$51$0$0#|
11752|#&7$Oriel##br#
"We've arrived... Stygian Peak!" Oriel floats ahead of you a few paces, her hair fluttering#br#
 in the almost visible heat drifting up from the ground. "...eternal prison of the Shadow#br#Dragon Queen..." #M351010$Oriel$821$$1$0#|
11753|#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"So, this is Stygian Peak, huh? Suppose it's a fitting name—it is, indeed, a peak, and it#br#
 IS, indeed, quite black in color!" Pelt rubs his chin while surveying the ember-strewn#br#
 landscape. "Now comes the real question, though—where exactly do we GO from here?" #M330090$Van Pelt$826$$1$0#|
11754|Depart for Stygian Peak|
11760|The mountain so nice, they named it... exactly as you'd describe it! You've made it to Stygian Peak! The Fire Dragon Army must still be a ways in front of you, however, because you've yet to spot a single sign of them.

Pelt ordains that the best thing to do would be to ask the locals for information. Get your game face on, because it's time for some interrogation!|
11761|#&7$Oriel##br#
 Oriel stares unblinkingly at Pelt's back until he turns to face her. She's clearly#br#unamused by his inconsequential commentary. #M351010$Oriel$1$$1$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"Ahem. Right, then! Seems like our best course of action would be to ask the locals for#br#
 any information on the Fire Dragon Army. I mean, if an entire army just marched its way #br# through your village, I'm sure you'd notice, right? We find the army, we find the sanctuary.#br#Piece o' crumb cake! Think you folks can handle it?" Pelt claps his hands together. #M330090$Van Pelt$821$$1$0#|
11762|#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"Find anything yet, %n%? Let me know when you do!" #M330090$Van Pelt$821$$1$0#|
11763|#&7$%n%##br#
 Confident that you've got all the information you need, you jog back to where Van#br#
 Pelt is laboriously sharpening his axe. You fill him in, then step back as your#br#colleagues begin drifting back one by one to add to the knowledge base.#char$$1$$0$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"Seems like you've all heard the same basic thing—I think we can take this as a pretty#br#
 solid confirmation of its validity, yeah? We should shove off, then! Who knows just how#br#far ahead that queen and her army have gotten by this point." Pelt pushes himself to#br#his feet and holsters his axe on his back with a clang. #M330090$Van Pelt$821$$1$0#|
11764|#&7$Dariella##br#
"A giant army? Oh, yeah! I saw 'em! Queen Esh-Baal was with 'em, too! They marched#br#
 off down that road over there! Seems like something important's going on!" The young#br#girl points somewhere off to the #&46$northeast#. #M602040$Dariella$821$$1$0#|
11765|#&7$Charles Hues##br#
"Why, I did see the queen's army, yes! If my memory serves me correctly, they left#br#
 via that road over yonder. Were in a bit of a rush, too. I would imagine they've#br#somewhere important to be." Charles points towards the road to the #&46$northeast#. #M326050$Charles Hues$4$$1$0#|
11766|#&7$Julesworth##br#
"Giant army? Yup. They went thattaway!"#br#
 The boy nods towards the #&46$northeast exit#. #M601040$Julesworth$4$$1$0#|
11770|Your stop at Tinsoot Village will be a short one, apparently—you already have all the information you need!

And it's a good thing, too. Every second spent twiddling your thumbs is one more step between you and the Fire Dragon Army! Head out the northeast exit and see how much time you can make up.|
11771|#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"C'mon, gents! Our presence is needed at that #&46$northeast exit#! If we double-time it,#br#
 we may just be able to make up for lost time." Pelt gestures in the direction of said#br#
 exit before glancing back to make sure everyone is present and accounted for.   #M330090$Van Pelt$821$$1$0#|
11772|#&7$Injured Soldier##br#
The poor soldiers coughs weakly, blood dribbling out the side of his mouth. #npcs100+30$$504$$1$0#|
11773|#&7$Oriel##br#
"This is... one of my sister's men!" Oriel rushes forward to support the man's head,#br# eyes trembling with worry. #M351010$Oriel$823$$1$0#

#&7$Injured Soldier##br#
"P-... Princess...?" The soldier coughs, splaying droplets of blood on Oriel's cheeks.#br# "Princess, is that... you?" The tiniest glimmer of hope twinkles from within the#br#
 inky, cold recesses of the man's eyes.#npcs100+30$$504$$1$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"Still got a bit of spunk left in him. I like that." Pelt kneels down beside the drakeling#br#
 and gives him a reassuring pat on his shoulder. "Take it easy, soldier. Tell us what#br#
 happened." #M330090$Van Pelt$1$$0$0#|
11774|Pursue the Fire Dragon Army|
11780|It's a trap! Just as you feel your heart reaching out for the poor, incapacitated soldier, you're surrounded on all sides by Copperhead thugs!

Time to skin some snakes!|
11781|#&7$Injured Soldier##br#
"P-Princess, you... you can't, it's an... an... an #&46$ambush#...!" With the last syllable#br#
 of "ambush" comes another splattering of blood.#npcs100+30$$504$$1$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
 "An ambush?!" Pelt gets immediately to his feet, one hand to the handle of his axe.#br#"I should have known something didn't feel right about this..." #M330090$Van Pelt$1$$0$0#|
11782|#&7$Injured Soldier##br#
The soldier coughs again before rolling onto his side, blood leaking from his nose#br#
 and mouth as though he were a cracked pot of blood fondue. You'd venture to say#br#he hasn't long left to live.#npcs100+30$$504$$1$0#|
11783|#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"Those assassins... they're Copperheads? Then they're working together with the#br#
 Shadow Dragon Army?! Of all the-...!" Pelt clamps his mouth shut to keep from uttering#br#
 a series of what you can only assume would be four-letter words. #M330090$Van Pelt$826$$1$0#

#&7$Injured Soldier##br#
"I'm... sorry..." The man struggles to breathe through his minced trachea. "P-Princess...#br#
 forgive me..." The rising and falling of his chest slows until you can scarcely see it move.#br#A bright red bubble of blood grows from between his lips before popping with a#br#splatter—and with that, the man is gone.#npcs100+30$$504$$1$0#

#&7$Oriel##br#
"My sister! Where is she? What's happened here!" Oriel takes a hold of the soldier's limp#br# shoulders and begins shaking him, tears blurring the blood splatters on her cheeks.
   #M351010$Oriel$821$$0$0#|
11790|The poor soldier isn't able to relay much more information even after your valiant efforts to neutralize the poison. Nevertheless, the central peak is dead ahead. You'll be there soon, and then you'll have a chance to pay BOTH the Shadow Dragon Army and the Copperheads back for their wonderful hospitality.

As you and your group shove off, you can't help but notice Ukyo paying extra close attention to Oriel. Maybe you should ask her what's the matter?|
11791|#&7$Injured Soldier##br#
"AMBUSHED!" The soldier sputters, eyes bloodshot and lips trembling. "We were...#br#
 ambushed... on this road..." You see him straining, fighting to stay conscious, but it's#br#
 a losing battle. "Don't... go... don't go... Princess..." Tears of blood well up in the man's#br#eyes before his pupils roll back into his head. With one last sigh, his body crumples.#npcs100+30$$504$56$1$0#

#&7$Oriel##br#
"Hey! Wake up! I'm still talking to you! Wake up, wake up, wake UP!!"#br# Oriel begins shaking the man again—harder this time—until his tongue#br#practically lolls out of his mouth. #M351010$Oriel$821$$0$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"Princess... PRINCESS!" Pelt reaches forward to lay a hand on Oriel's shoulder, stilling#br#
 her frenzied assault on the poor man's corpse. "I'm... I'm afraid he really has passed#br#this time, Your Highness." #M330090$Van Pelt$1$$1$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"Unfortunately, there's nothing more we can do for these men. Our only choice is to#br#
 press forward and make sure those bastards pay dearly for what they've done. It can't#br# be much further by this point... Let's gather up our things and make tracks." #M330090$Van Pelt$1$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You couldn't agree more. Your fingers twitching for revenge, you and the rest of your#br#group take off without another word. That sanctuary is so close, you can almost taste it!#char$$301$$0$0#|
11792|#&7$Ukyo##br#
 You can't help but notice Ukyo's frequent glances in Oriel's direction... #M043090$Ukyo$1$$1$0#|
11793|#&7$%n%##br#
 Curiosity finally getting the best of you, you pull Ukyo off to the side and ask her just#br#what's going on. Is Oriel really that bewitching? Or has she noticed something fishy?#char$$301$$0$0#

#&7$Ukyo##br#
"Hmm..." Ukyo folds her arms over her chest, one finger tapping her lips. "It's just...#br#
 tell me I'm not imagining things, okay? Oriel's awfully anxious, don't you think? I#br#
 mean more so than usual. And it's only getting worse the closer we get to that sanctuary..." #M043090$Ukyo$4$$1$0#|
11800|Oriel's emotions are more convoluted than the current state of the U.S. political race! And they only keep getting worse. You pull Ukyo off to the side to get her take on the matter, but just as you're getting to the nitty-gritty, Oriel collapses behind you!

Quick—find out what's the matter!|
11801|#&7$Ukyo##br#
"I've been watching her ever since we left that village earlier. I thought something was#br#
 off even then, but I wanted to confirm my suspicions, you know? And I couldn't have#br#
 been more right. Her #&46$emotions are all over the place right now#! I mean, you saw what#br#she did to that soldier earlier, yeah? Surprised she didn't snap his neck..." #M043090$Ukyo$4$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You hit the replay button on the scene with the dying soldier in your mind. You see#br#
 that neck of his bending and warping and lurching back and forth with stomach-#br#turning snap, crackle, pops. You almost lose your lunch. Quickly wiping the image from#br#your mind, you comment that anyone in her situation would probably behave as such.#char$$826$$0$0#

#&7$Ukyo##br#
"Perhaps. I'm just thinking that, well, when I get emotionally compromised like that,#br#
 I tend to—" Before Ukyo can even finish her sentence, you hear a thud from behind#br#
 you, and you both spin around to see Oriel collapsed in a heap on the ground. #M043090$Ukyo$1$$1$0#
|
11802|#&7$Oriel##br#
 Oriel is still unconscious. #M350010+55$Oriel$504$56$1$0#|
11803|#&7$Ashar##br#
"Oh, Oriel..." #M353010$Ashar$1$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Still trying to recollect your thoughts—and body parts—you ask Ashar what in God's#br#great gravy just happened. Why would Oriel suddenly attack you like that?!#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Ashar##br#
"When the Dragon Queens imprisoned Zilthai within the sanctuary, it required all of#br#
 their power, including their #&46$innate draconic instincts#—instincts, regretfully, to kill. I#br#
 The Shadow Cabal must have already reached the prison and begun loosening the seal...#br#
 tumultuous energy is now running rampant, affecting those not strong enough to resist it..."
   #M353010$Ashar$821$$1$0#

#&7$Ashar##br#
"I feared this would happen... This entire mountain is now charged with a wild,#br#
 you must prevent them from breaking Zilthai's seal." #M353010$Ashar$4$$1$0#|
11804|Subdue Oriel|
11805|Check on Oriel's condition|
11810|You're successful in getting Oriel back under control—and looking very much human again—but it'll take her some time to fully recover.

Pelt suggests Lenora stay behind to watch over her while the rest of you move quickly to the sanctuary. You've got to stop them from breaking that seal! You just hope you won't be too late...|
11811|#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"I have a feeling the princess won't be going anywhere for a while... Lenora, could#br#
 you stay here and keep an eye on her? The rest of us should hurry to the sanctuary.#br#
 If the Shadow Dragon Army really is weakening the seal already..." Pelt bites down#br#on his lip, casting his eyes away. "At any rate, let's hurry." #M330090$Van Pelt$1$$1$0#|
11812|#&7$Ashar##br#
"To think they could have weakened the seal so much so quickly..."#M353010$Ashar$4$$1$0#|
11813|#&7$Ashar##br#
"Dear sister... what have you done?"#M353010$Ashar$828$$1$0#|
11814|Enter the Sealed Sanctuary|
11815|Find Esh-Baal|
11816|Defeat the Copperhead Flunkies|
11817|Enter the Sealed Sanctuary|
11820|The duel with her sister has left Ashar shaky and frail (and more than a little mentally exhausted), but she's still able to offer you that kind smile you've grown to know so well.

Ashar begs you to prevent the Shadow Cabal from destroying the seal.|
11821|#&7$Ashar##br#
"I-... I apologize. I'm not sure what came over me." You can tell from Ashar's worn#br# features that the previous bout with Zilthai'd taken a lot out of her. She rubs the#br#
 moisture from her eyes before attempting a somewhat encouraging smile. #M353010$Ashar$821$$1$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"No need to worry, Your Highness. More than understandable—truly!" #M330090$Van Pelt$4$$0$0#

#&7$Ashar##br#
"We simply cannot let my sister escape into this world. She has succumbed too deep!#br#
 Please, I implore you... You must do something. If they destroy the seal... it's too dreadful to even consider!" #M353010$Ashar$822$$1$0#|
11822|#&7$Van Pelt##br#
 Pelt seems to be mulling over what Katya'd said back in the sanctuary. #M330090$Van Pelt$1$56$1$0#|
11823|#&7$%n%##br#
 Upon returning to the Volcazar, you immediately find Van Pelt and inquire as to#br#Esh-Baal's condition.#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"Not great. We patched her up as well as we could, but I have a feeling she won't be#br#
 coming around anytime soon. That brawl left her in pretty bad shape." Pelt turns#br#
 his eyes towards the big double doors leading to the royal chamber, his brows#br#
 furrowed. "All we can do now is wait for Oriel to wake up, I suppose." #M330090$Van Pelt$1$$1$0#|
11824|Enter the Sealed Sanctuary|
11825|Find Esh-Baal|
11826|Subdue Esh-Baal (reduce her HP to less than 60%)|
11830|Oriel has finally awoken, but Esh-Baal is still in critical condition! Oriel believes her sister requires the attention of a doctor to fully recover, and not just any doctor—the best doctor in the Volcazar! Hurry to Dragonling Cobbles and find Chief Physician Brickscoat. If anyone can help Esh-Baal, she can!|
11831|#&7$Oriel##br#
"Oh, Esh-Baal... I'm so sorry... if only I could have been stronger. If only I could have#br#
 done something to protect you!" Oriel's tearful voice breaks the somewhat uncomfortable#br#
 silence, and soon her familiar visage floats down beside you. "Tell me... tell me what#br#
 happened! I must know who did this to her..." #M351010$Oriel$1$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 With the tiniest of sighs, you begin recounting the events that transpired deep within#br#the sanctuary in as much detail as you can muster. The images resurrected in your#br#mind make your stomach roil.#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Oriel##br#
"N-no! Then we... couldn't protect the seal? Then... the Shadow Dragon Queen, she...?" #M351010$Oriel$821$56$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You say you're not sure exactly what happened after your group escaped the sanctuary.#br#Esh-Baal's injuries had become top priority, and Katya and her troupe had made pursuit#br#of the masked man impossible.#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Oriel##br#
Tiny tears well up in the corners of Oriel's eyes, but she quickly brings the back of her#br# hand up to wipe them away. "Yes, my sister should be top priority." Taking a deep breath,#br# she recomposes herself and looks you straight in the eye. "Brickscoat. You must fetch#br#
 Brickscoat. She's a brilliant doctor. I know she'll be able to help my sister."
   #M351010$Oriel$4$$1$0#|
11832|#&7$Oriel##br#
"Oh, Esh-Baal... I'm so sorry..." Oriel refuses to move from Esh-Baal's bedside.
   #M351010$Oriel$1$$1$0#|
11833|#&7$Brickscoat##br#
 The room is as silent as the grave as everyone watches Brickscoat busy herself at#br#Esh-Baal's bedside. #M707040$Brickscoat$601$$1$0#

#&7$Oriel##br#
"How... how is she?" #M351010$Oriel$4$$0$0#

#&7$Brickscoat##br#
"It's been a long battle, but she's now in stable condition." #M707040$Brickscoat$822$$1$0#

#&7$Oriel##br#
"Oh... oh, thank the maker!" The tears return to Oriel's eyes as she lets out a#br#
 much-needed sigh of relief. #M351010$Oriel$1$$0$0#|
11834|#&7$%n%##br#
 You practically stumble over yourself—lungs burning and legs like jelly—as you reach#br#the home of the Volcazar's most esteemed and respected doctor, Brickscoat.#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Brickscoat##br#
The elderly woman in question blinks her eyes in surprise at your sudden, disheveled#br#
 appearance, and hurriedly helps you to your feet. "Whatever is the matter, dear? You#br#
 look as though you've seen a ghost!" #M707040$Brickscoat$823$$1$0#

#&7$Brickscoat##br#
Coughing and sputtering, you managed to eke out that Esh-Baal has been injured and is#br#in dire need of a doctor's care. Brickscoat's kindly eyes narrow—transformed from a#br#gentle old soul into a practiced physician in an instant—and she immediately#br#grabs her things. "Show me the way!" #M707040$Brickscoat$4$$1$0#|
11840|The masked man and envoy of the Shadow Dragon Army turns out to be none other than the Fire Dragon sisters' very own brother Ashkenaz! The betrayal runs as deep as your lust for revenge!

There's much to be done, now, if the seal is going to be restored and the Shadow Dragon Army stopped for good, and with Esh-Baal's acceptance (finally!), you and your fellow Falcons are going to be there for every second of it.|
11841|#&7$Oriel##br#
Oriel kneels down by Esh-Baal's bed, and you can just barely hear her whisper softly#br#
 in her sister's ear. "You just rest now, Eshy... you just rest..." #M351010$Oriel$1$56$1$0#

#&7$Oriel##br#
"My dear friends, I want to thank each and every one of you for what you've done.#br#
 Even after asking so much of you, you continue to lend us your aid. You've saved#br#
 my sister, and you've saved me... I can never repay you." Oriel's eyes quiver. #M351010$Oriel$822$$1$0#

#&7$Oriel##br#
"We should let my sister rest, now... Let us move this discussion outdoors and#br#
 decide what our next course of action should be." Oriel gestures towards the#br#
 door, and you and your fellow Falcons file out one by one. #M351010$Oriel$821$$1$0#

#&7$Esh-Baal##br#
"O-... Oriel... is that... you?"   #M350010$Esh-Baal$501$$0$0#

#&7$Oriel##br#
"Eshy! You're awake!" #M351010$Oriel$822$$1$0#

#&7$Esh-Baal##br#
"Where... am I? What am I doing here? I-... I was... in the sanctuary, and then...#br# ASHKENAZ. Oriel, WHERE is ASHKENAZ?! We have to... to stop him before#br#
 he..." A wracking cough cuts Esh-Baal off before she can continue, her whole#br# body shuddering with each impetus.
   #M350010$Esh-Baal$823$$0$0#

#&7$Oriel##br#
"Please calm yourself, Esh-Baal. There's no need to worry! We're safely back in the#br# Volcazar. These Falcons brought the two of us back! They... they saved our lives."#br#
 Oriel points towards you and the others, who are now gathered at the door and#br#
 peeping inside like curious cats. #M351010$Oriel$4$$1$0#

#&7$Esh-Baal##br#
"Then we... we couldn't stop him? We couldn't...?" Esh-Baal holds her head in#br# one hand, giving herself a moment to rest before gazing up to acknowledge#br#
 your group at the door. #M350010$Esh-Baal$826$56$0$0#

#&7$Esh-Baal##br#
"I... apologize for my rudeness, humans. It was unbecoming of me. And I-... I wish to#br# thank you. For what you've done. For saving my sister and I." She shakes her head#br#
 before running a hand through her long bangs. "We probably wouldn't be here otherwise..." #M350010$Esh-Baal$822$$0$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"Your Highness, just a moment ago you mentioned someone named Ashkenaz."#br# Pelt steps forward from the door. "You're not referring to your brother, the prince,#br#are you?" #M330090$Van Pelt$821$$1$0#

#&7$Esh-Baal##br#
"Unfortunately, I'm referring to one and the same, though I wish I wasn't. I didn't#br# want to believe it, and I kept trying to convince myself otherwise, but that last attack#br#
 That's why I couldn't put a stop to the Shadow Cabal earlier when I was at the prison site...#br#
 the Shadow Dragon Envoy—the one behind the mask."
  
   #M350010$Esh-Baal$826$56$0$0#

#&7$Esh-Baal##br#
"And now we're here and can no longer hide the fact that Ashkenaz is a member of the Shadow Cabal.#br#
 He's betrayed us. Betrayed me." Gritting her teeth together, she pauses a moment to#br#collect herself before continuing. "I'll need to inform the other Dragon Kingdoms#br#and request aid. The situation has progressed beyond Fire Dragon jurisdiction." #M350010$Esh-Baal$821$$0$0#

#&7$Esh-Baal##br#
"As for you humans—no. As for you fine warriors... and fine friends, I know that we#br# have asked so much of you already, but would you be willing to stay in this kingdom#br#
 a bit longer? I have a feeling we'll need all the help we can get..." #M350010$Esh-Baal$822$$0$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"I think we may have a... thing or two we still need to get done here ourselves, now,#br# don't we?" Pelt crosses his arms in front of his chest before throwing a grin back to#br#
 you and the others still in the doorway. #M330090$Van Pelt$821$$1$0#

#&7$Crowd##br#
All of you raise your fists with identical affirmative cheers. Looks like your own#br#Enchanted Drachmar Chronicles are just getting started!#M330090$Van Pelt$1$$1$0#|
11842|#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"Drakelings are stronger than us humans by nature, you know. But that just means#br#
 we need to work twice as hard to get in shape! Up those weights, squirt!" #M330090$Van Pelt$4$51$1$0#|
11843|#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"You holdin' up, %n%? Ridin' the storm? Rockin' the wave?#br#
 I know this is all a lot to take in—and a lot to ask from each of you—but I'm sure you#br#
 agree that it's the right thing to do, yeah?" Pelt claps his hand on your shoulder with#br# a reassuring bear grip. "Take this time to recharge. I'm gonna need you in top form!" #M330090$Van Pelt$4$51$1$0#|
11850|Turns out the man violently coughing up blood is, in fact, NOT dead! He's simply been poisoned with Terrorantula venom! With this wonderful news in mind, Pelt asks you go collect a few sacs from these asinine arachnids to see if you can't revive the man and get more information about Esh-Baal's whereabouts.

Head to the nearby Flickerflare Forest and get spider snipin'!|
11851|#&7$Injured Soldier##br#
As Oriel shakes the soldier's body, blood flings from his mouth and nose, and his#br#
 head bounces up and down like a rubbery noodle. The sight makes you a bit nauseous...#npcs100+30$$504$$1$0#

#&7$Oriel##br#
"Hey! Don't pass out on me! Open your eyes! I need to know what happened to#br# my sister!" Oriel only grows more frustrated at the dead man's silence.   #M351010$Oriel$821$$0$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"Wait a minute. Princess, step back for a second." #M330090$Van Pelt$1$$0$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
Pelt kneels down to check the man's pulse, then uses a finger to pry open his mouth#br#
 and examine his tongue. "Surprisingly, he's not dead. He's just been poisoned. More#br#
 of the Shadow Dragon Army's handiwork, if I had to hazard a guess."#npcs100+30$$504$$1$0#

#&7$Oriel##br#
"Poisoned?!" Oriel's pupils dilate in disbelief. "They... they must have used Terrorantula#br#
 venom! One bite has been said to be capable of incapacitating ten drakelings!" She floats#br#
 back and forth with anxious flutters of her wings. "There IS an antidote, though—inside#br#the sacs of the spiders themselves! But they're SO gross..." #M351010$Oriel$821$$0$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"Ha! Easy-peasy, then, am I right? %n%, you're not scared of a few giant, eight-legged#br#
 creepy-crawlies, are you?" Pelt gives you an encouraging—and mildly painful—shake#br#of the shoulder. "Didn't think so! So go get us some #&46$spider sacs#, yeah? And#br#be quick about it! This guy might just die on us anyway..." #M330090$Van Pelt$4$$0$0#|
11852|#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"How's it comin' on those sacs, %n%? If you're wondering how to nab 'em, all you've#br# gotta do is reach up inside those great, big spider bums of theirs and yank 'em out!" #M330090$Van Pelt$1$$1$0#|
11853|#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"Ah, perfect! This should be plenty. Give 'em to me and I'll... 'administer' them..." #M330090$Van Pelt$1$$1$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
Unsure you want to know exactly how Pelt plans to 'administer' the sacs, you turn#br#
 your head away with an awkward cough. You don't look back until you hear Pelt#br#talking softly to the soldier. #M330090$Van Pelt$1$$1$0#

#&7$Injured Soldier##br#
"..."#br#
 A dribble of snot-laced blood leaks from the soldier's nose, but he doesn't make a peep.#npcs100+30$$504$$1$0#|
11860|First, spider sacs, and now, baby bat gallbladders?! Things are getting more disgusting by the second around here, but you've got no choice—Pelt's word is law, after all.

Head back out and relieve a few baby Vambats of their gallbladders...|
11861|#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"Well, THAT was a dead end. And here I had to go and yucky myself in the process."
 #M330090$Van Pelt$826$$1$0#

#&7$Oriel##br#
"Hmm... perhaps we're missing some sort of catalyst for the antidote. I've heard that#br#
 the #&46$bile of baby Vambats# has been known to do the trick. Perhaps if we just had a bit#br#of that..." #M351010$Oriel$821$$0$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"Bat bile! Lovely! Guess we don't have much choice, though. %n%! Get out there and#br#nab us some bile. Probably would work best if you just brought back the whole#br#gallbladder, yeah?" #M330090$Van Pelt$826$$1$0#|
11862|#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"I know it's kinda gross, but just bear with me here, all right?" #M330090$Van Pelt$1$$1$0#|
11863|#&7$Oriel##br#
 You return with the oozing gallbladders clutched between your shivering fingers and#br#hand them off with a breath of relief. You NEVER want to do that AGAIN! #M351010$Oriel$1$$1$0#

#&7$Injured Soldier##br#
Oriel uses what looks like a tiny syringe to remove a bit of bile from the gallbladders#br#
 before injecting it into the injured soldier's neck. It's silent for a moment, and then—with#br#a hacking, sputtering cough that sends clotted blood over the entire group—the man jerks#br#upright.#npcs100+30$$504$$1$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
Pelt wipes speckles of blood from his eyes. "It worked!" #M330090$Van Pelt$1$$0$0#

#&7$Oriel##br#
Oriel has a hold of the man's shoulders again almost instantly, her eyes so fierce you'd#br# swear they could light the man on fire. "Where is my sister? Tell me what happened here!"
   #M351010$Oriel$821$$0$0#|
14580|Van Pelt asks you to accompany him on his visit to Queen Esh-Baal.|
14581|#&7$%n%##br#
 You're just about to make your morning report when you find Van Pelt in some sort#br#of furtive discussion with Delphia.#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Delphia##br#
"You're not still... thinking about what Katya said, are you?" #M327090$Delphia$4$$0$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"I don't know. I mean, normally I'd disregard anything any one of those Copperheads#br#
 said, but... somehow I just can't shake it. We've always had our... differences with the#br#
 Copperheads, but why? I've never really thought about it." Pelt rubs his chin. #&7$Van Pelt##br#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You call out to them before handing over your report.#char$$801$$0$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"Looks like you've been putting the pedal to the metal, %n%.#br#
 Excellent work." Pelt flicks through your report. #&7$Van Pelt##br#

#&7$Delphia##br#
"Thank you for all your hard work as always, %n%." #M327090$Delphia$4$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You respond confidently that you're only doing your duty.#char$$1$$0$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"I actually wanted to ask you something, %n%. What's, erm, your educated opinion#br#on the Holy Dragon Queen?" #&7$Van Pelt##br#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You're not sure what to say for a moment. Finally, you ask why he wants to know.#char$$821$$0$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"Why? Haha... hahahaha! Oh, you know, no reason, really. Guess I was just wondering.#br# At any rate, I was just on my way to pay a visit to good Queen Esh-Baal. Fancy joining#br# me?"   #&7$Van Pelt##br#|
14582|...|
14583|#&7$Esh-Baal##br#
"Ah, thanks for coming. I'm feeling much better now, thankfully. Just#br# needed a bit of rest, is all. It's all thanks to you, though." Esh-Baal#br#
 nods her head in gracious acknowledgement. #M360010$Esh-Baal$822$$1$0#|
14584|The bridge! How could...?|
14585|Wh-what was that?|
14586|Who's there?!|
14587|"I-... Something doesn't feel right..."|
14588|It's too quiet...|
14589|No! It's a trap!|
14590|Esh-Baal mentions that Jacque the blacksmith is in need of an extra hand or two. Perhaps you can lend him yours?

Head downtown and see what he needs.|
14591|#&7$Esh-Baal##br#
"I've already asked much of you, %n%, and you've already DONE so much#br# for me and my people. I cannot thank you enough. Unfortunately, there is still#br#
 work to be done before this is all over. I hope that you'll continue to lend us#br# your aid?" #M360010$Esh-Baal$822$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 "Is there something I can help with?"#char$$821$$0$0#

#&7$Esh-Baal##br#
"As a matter of fact, yes. We've run dreadfully short of supplies and weapons after#br#
 that little... 'skirmish,' I guess you might call it. On the mountain, I mean. Our blacksmith,#br# Jacque, is in need of people to assist him. Perhaps you could lend him a hand?" #M360010$Esh-Baal$821$$1$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"Think you can take care of this one, %n%? I've got a few things I still need to#br# discuss with Her Majesty." Pelt gives you one of his patent-pending overzealous#br#pats on the back. #M330090$Van Pelt$4$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 After recovering from having the air knocked out of your body, you give a crisp#br#salute and say you'll handle it as best you can.#char$$4$$0$0#|
14592|#&7$Esh-Baal##br#
 Looks like Esh-Baal and Van Pelt are still discussing things. Best to leave them#br# alone for now. #M360010$Esh-Baal$1$$1$0#|
14593|#&7$Jacque##br#
"One... two... three... galdurn it! I swear we had more than this."#br# You see Jacque muttering to himself as you approach.
 #npc$$4$$1$0#|
14600|Jacque asks you to head back to Stygian Peak and gather up any left-behind supplies and weapons you can find.

Hopefully there's something left!|
14601|#&7$%n%##br#
 You inform Jacque that Esh-Baal sent you to lend a hand.#char$$821$$0$0#

#&7$Jacque##br#
"Really? How perfect! I was just thinking I could use a person or two to help me#br# out. Pretty short on both supplies AND manpower as of late. Workers have been#br# hard to come by, yeah? Everyone's flying the coop, so to speak."
  
   #npc$$4$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You relay Esh-Baal's instructions and assert that you'll do everything in your power#br#
 to assist him in whatever way you can, then ask if there's anything you can do.#char$$821$$0$0#

#&7$Jacque##br#
"Let's see, let's see... Well, it's just like Her Majesty explained already—we're desperately#br# short of weapons after the battle, right? A lot of our stuff got left up on the mountain,#br# and we don't have the time or manpower to start again from scratch. You think you can#br# head back up to Stygian Peak and recover whatever you can find?"
  
    
 #npc$$4$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You respond that you'd be more than happy to (even if you don't exactly fancy the trek).#char$$821$$0$0#|
14602|#&7$Jacque##br#
"Thanks a bunch! I know it's a bit out of the way, but we really need SOMEthing#br# to get our supplies back in a state of non-emergency, if you get my drift."#npc$$822$$1$0#|
14603|#&7$Jacque##br#
"Oh! You're back! Wonderful. Let's take a look at what you've rustled up, yeah?#br# Hm hmmm... not bad! Not bad. Some of the stuff's a bit busted up, but, well, we#br# can always recast. Always better than starting from scratch, that's for sure."
       #npc$$821$$1$0#|
14604|Twilight Vigil Society|
14605|Hmph.|
14606|That's brutal!|
14607|Something about the voice sounds SO familiar, but you just can't place it.|
14610|Jacque informs you that Pelt is looking for you. As you're not entirely sure where Pelt IS, however, it's probably best to head back to the castle and find Esh-Baal.

She might know where he is!|
14611|#&7$Jacque##br#
"Ah, right! Wanted to tell you before I forgot—Van Pelt came by looking for you.#br# Not sure why, and not sure where he went, either. He left in the direction of the#br# castle, though."#npc$$821$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You nod your head with a crisp flick and ask if there isn't anything else he needs done first.#char$$821$$0$0#

#&7$Jacque##br#
"Nah, I can handle the rest. You'd better get going, though. Don't wanna risk a#br# tongue-lashing, am I right?"#npc$$4$$1$0#|
14612|#&7$Jacque##br#
"See if Her Majesty has any idea where Pelt's run off to!"#npc$$1$$1$0#|
14613|#&7$%n%##br#
 You ask Pelt what he thinks your next move should be.#char$$822$$0$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"Well, as I mentioned earlier, we've been finding traces of the Copperheads everywhere.#br#
 All we know is that they're helping the Shadow Dragon Army, but we don't know for#br#
 sure what their angle is. We also have no idea what the Shadow Dragon Army plans to#br# do next. I'd say our best bet is to form a couple small teams and investigate."
   #M330090$Van Pelt$1$$1$0#|
14614|#&7$%n%##br#
 When you get back to the castle, you find Pelt still discussing something off to the side with Esh-Baal.#char$$301$$0$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"%n%! Perfect timing!" Pelt notices you immediately and beckons for you to come over.  
   #M330090$Van Pelt$4$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You relay your work with Jacque to Esh-Baal and ask if there's anything else that needs doing.#char$$822$$0$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"The queen and I have been discussing our next move." #M330090$Van Pelt$4$$1$0#

#&7$Esh-Baal##br#
"We've received reports of unidentified tracks alongside the ones you left. Whoever#br# they are, they don't appear to be in league with the Shadow Dragon Army, but as#br#
 we don't know their motives, we also can't immediately label them as friend OR foe.#br# We'd best continue to bide our time and wait for the Shadow Dragons to show their hand."
   #M360010$Esh-Baal$821$$1$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"I'm not sure just sitting around on our haunches would be the best course of action#br# either, though. Perhaps if one of my men were to track them down from afar to see#br# if we can't get a better clue what we're up against here..."
     #M330090$Van Pelt$4$$1$0#

#&7$Esh-Baal##br#
"...hm, you make a good point. I'll keep my army here to continue rebuilding our#br# forces. You send out a small team to keep us in the know?" #M360010$Esh-Baal$822$$1$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"Sounds like a plan. I'll go rally the boys."   #M330090$Van Pelt$822$$1$0#|
14620|Pelt asks you and Ukyo to scout out the northern border.

Go let Ukyo know about the new plan.|
14621|#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"%n%, why don't you and Ukyo go scout out the northern border, yeah?#br# You know what she can be like already, so you two should get along just#br# fine. The others don't seem to really... GET her, if you know what I mean." #M330090$Van Pelt$1$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You nod in affirmation.#char$$822$$0$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"Wonderful. Go let Ukyo know then, would you? The sooner you can head out,#br# the better. Would be really nice having a couple pairs of eyes to help us keep adrift#br#
 of the situation out there, yeah? I'll let the rest of the team know about the plan."#br# Pelt gives your shoulder a little shake.
   #M330090$Van Pelt$1$$1$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"Try not to engage anyone if at all possible, yeah? We still don't know what the Shadow#br#
 Dragon Army is up to, and you could quickly find yourself in over your head." #M330090$Van Pelt$1$$1$0#|
14622|...|
14623|#&7$%n%##br#
 You've just reached the Northern Sea Bridge when you hear shouting from nearby.#br#It brings you to a halt.#char$$1$$0$0#

#&7$Angry Villagers##br#
"Humans?! Not again! Leave this place! You should never have come here!"#br# It seems the shouts are... directed at you?!

 Ukyo listens carefully as you relay Pelt's orders. #M043090$Ukyo$4$$1$0#

#&7$Ukyo##br#
"Understood. Let's blow this popsicle stand, then. No reason to slum around."   #M043090$Ukyo$4$$1$0#|
14630|The head villager seems apoplectic with rage. Ukyo suggest you inquire as to what's made them so upset. You couldn't agree more.|
14631|#&7$%n%##br#
 You ask the villagers why they're so angry.#char$$1$$0$0#

#&7$Angry Villagers##br#
"You don't know? You don't KNOW?! HAH! Go and ask THEM, yeah?#br# Just look at them! YOU did that, you hear? YOU!" The villagers don't seem#br# to be in the mood for a calm chat.  
 #npc$$825$$1$0#

#&7$Ukyo##br#
"What we've got here is failure to communicate. You just can't reach 'em all."#br# Ukyo glances over at you somewhat apathetically.
   #M043090$Ukyo$4$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Whoever this is is really not in the mood to talk. You suggest going straight to the source#br#and asking the rather aggrieved-looking villagers just ahead.#char$$1$$0$0#|
14632|#&7$%n%##br#
 This guy's losing it. You highly doubt you'll be able to get any information out of#br# him. Best ask the other villagers for more information.#char$$1$$0$0#|

14634|#&7$Evan##br#
"You mean you don't know? Only a short while ago, a bunch of humans came wandering#br# through here. We didn't think any of it until almost immediately after, the lurkers in the#br#

"Owwwww... my poor botto—HEY! Don't look at me when I'm tending to my wounds.#br#

14643|#&7$Ukyo##br#
"..."#M043090$Ukyo$4$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You ask Ukyo if she's found anything.#char$$821$$0$0#

#&7$Ukyo##br#
"I have, indeed. Smell this. Kinda weird, don't you think? Lurkers normally don't#br#
 have this kind of smell..." #M043090$Ukyo$4$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You say it smells vaguely familiar, but you can't quite pin it down.#char$$821$$0$0#|
14650|Something was just a bit... off about that lurker's scent. You have a feeling there's more to what's going on than meets the eye.|
14651|#&7$Ukyo##br#
"That moory-muck down whats-it should be just up ahead. If we keep going, we#br# might find some more clues." #M043090$Ukyo$351$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
  You nod and follow along wordlessly.#char$$301$$0$0#|
14652|...|
14653|#&7$%n%##br#
 You think back and recall seeing similar markings on the other lurkers you'd slain.#br# Perhaps they're all connected after all?#char$$1$$0$0#|
14660|You can't help but notice the strange look on Ukyo's face, but you know better now than to question her about it. Besides, you've got a job to do.

Focus on gathering those herbs for Lyrie.|
14661|#&7$%n%##br#
 Ukyo's expression freezes as soon as she lays eyes on the markings.#br# You ask if she recognizes them.#char$$1$$0$0#

#&7$Ukyo##br#
"It... it can't be..." #M043090$Ukyo$4$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Intrigued, you ask her what "can't be."#char$$1$$0$0#

#&7$Ukyo##br#
"It's... I mean... it's nothing! Nothing. C'mon. Those herbs over there must be#br# what Lyrie was talking about. We should grab some and head back."#br# Ukyo abruptly steps away and begins yanking tufts of herbs out of the dirt.
   #M043090$Ukyo$351$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You shrug to yourself and follow along, knowing you're probably not going to get any answers.#char$$1$$0$0#|
14662|...|
14663|#&7$%n%##br#
 You give the herbs to Lyrie and tell him what happened.#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Lyrie##br#
"Oh, blessed day! You can't know how thankful I am for this. Though I fear#br# I've delayed you for too long now. I apologize again for what happened... this is#br#
 a rather remote village, after all. Information can be... SLOW to reach us, as you#br# can imagine.  
 #npc$$822$$1$0#|
14664|This magic seems... oddly familiar. You wrack your brain to see if you can't pinpoint it, but the answer seems just out of reach.|
14665|The Copperheads have experts in beast-controlling magic.|
14666|Seems they're already taking precautions. Come on—let's just get these herbs back.|
14670|According to Lyrie, you're actually at the border between the Water and Fire Dragon Kingdoms! No one, however, has ever set foot within the Water Dragon Kingdom...

Lyrie suggests asking the traveling merchant who often visits the village on the opposite bank for more information.|
14671|#&7$%n%##br#
 You shake your head humbly, replying that you're just doing what anyone else would#br#have done. You then ask if there's been any update regarding the situation on the frontier.#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Lyrie##br#
"It would seem this place stands at the threshold between the Fire and Water Dragon Kingdoms..."#npc$$4$$1$0#

#&7$Ukyo##br#
"It would seem? What is THAT supposed to mean?" #M043090$Ukyo$4$$1$0#

#&7$Lyrie##br#
"Well... I can't say that we've ever seen evidence of this, is all I'm saying. My people have#br#
 lived here for generations, yet we've not laid eyes on a single Water Dragon."#npc$$4$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You ask how they even know about the possibility of this kingdom, then.#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Lyrie##br#
"I'm afraid you've got the wrong person for that kind of information. There's a little#br# merchant village across the bridge, however, on the opposite bank. A lotta merchants#br#
 come and go between here and there. One of them would surely be able to provide#br#
 you with more information." #npc$$4$$1$0#|
14672|...|
14673|#&7$%n%##br#
 You go and accost a nearby traveling merchant.#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Traveling Merchant##br#
"Huh? You customers or something?" #npc$$4$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You say you want to know more about the Water Dragon Kingdom.#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Traveling Merchant##br#
"'Zat so? The Water Dragon Kingdom. Can't say I'd be very much obliged to#br# part with this information, if I do say so myself..." #npc$$4$$1$0#

#&7$Ukyo##br#
"..."#br#
 Ukyo's eyes stare straight through the man's soul. #M043090$Ukyo$1$$0$0#|
14680|If you're gonna be getting any information, it looks like you'll have to pay back the favor, so to speak, and Pufferbird feathers seems like the way to do it.

Find some Pufferbirds and get pluckin'!|
14681|#&7$Traveling Merchant##br#
"Well, at the end of the day, I'm still a merchant, see? Which means I may be open#br# to a little exchange of sorts. Perhaps if you made some kind of, shall we say, starting#br#
 offer? I might be willing to divulge a little information..."#npc$$4$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You ask him what type of "offer" he has in mind.#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Traveling Merchant##br#
"What type of offer? Hmm... well, I've always been taken by sparkly things...#br# No, no, no! I've got a better idea. Feathers! Pufferbird feathers, to be more#br#
 exact. I could make a pretty penny off those things. You get me some, and I'll#br#
 tell you a bit about that there kingdom in question."#npc$$4$$1$0#

#&7$Ukyo##br#
"We don't have time for this. Come on, %n%. Let's go."#br# Ukyo begins marching away.
   #M043090$Ukyo$4$$1$0#

#&7$Traveling Merchant##br#
"Whoa, whoa, whoooooa! C'mon! Don't you wanna know the way to get into the Water#br#
 Dragon Kingdom? That's what you're after, isn't it?" The merchant casually buffs the#br#shiny balls of his abacus.#npc$$4$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Intrigued, you turn back around and ask just how he would have come by this#br#information in the first place.#char$$823$$0$0#

#&7$Traveling Merchant##br#
"I'm a merchant! I have ways of collecting information, so to speak. But hey, if you really#br# don't wanna know, it's fine with me. It's not like I'm losing out on anything, and I have#br# plenty of other work to do." The merchant shrugs, preparing to turn around and get back#br#
 to work.#npc$$4$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Neither of you like his attitude, but you really need his information, so you decide to split#br#up and look for the plumage of said puffy birds.#char$$1$$0$0#|
14682|#&7$Traveling Merchant##br#
"Off with you, then! Go, go, go! Time is money, after all!" #npc$$4$$1$0#|
14683|#&7$Ukyo##br#
"That enough for you?"#br#
 You had the feathers you've collected to the merchant. #M043090$Ukyo$4$$0$0#

#&7$Traveling Merchant##br#
"Hohoho! Not bad! Not bad at all! And they're in such good condition, too!#br# You guys are even better than I thought!" The merchant's grin widens exponentially#br# as he scrutinizes the feathers you brought back.
 #npc$$4$$1$0#|
14690|You always knew you were good at your job, but now you're TOO good. The merchant wants you to get him some Pufferbird eggs, too. You don't have much choice in the matter, either.

Get back to those Puffers and gather up some eggs!|
14691|#&7$Traveling Merchant##br#
"Weeeeeell... seems inflation has really put me in a tight spot, you know? Can't#br# keep up with the rising prices! As such, the price of information has gone up as#br#
 well. Why don't you go get me a few Pufferbird eggs to sweeten the deal, yeah?#br# Should be easy for someone of your caliber!" The merchant smiles slyly.
 #npc$$4$$1$0#

#&7$Ukyo##br#
"..."#M043090$Ukyo$1$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You murmur to Ukyo that you don't have much choice but to do as he says—you've come#br#this far already, so you might as well. Kinda like butchering and eating your own leg.#char$$821$$0$0#|
14692|#&7$Traveling Merchant##br#
 When you return, you find the merchant in the midst of lighting a fire.#npc$$1$$1$0#|
14693|#&7$Traveling Merchant##br#
"Oh! You're back! Wonderful! Hohoho, today is a lucky day for me, inDEED!"#br# He wiggles his fingers in anticipation and steps over to see what you've brought him.    
 #npc$$824$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You say it's about time he told you what you want to know.#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Traveling Merchant##br#
"Of course, of COURSE! I would never DREAM of going back on my word.#br# I'm an honest man, after all! Come now, come now! Ye of little faith!" #npc$$4$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You can't help but sigh and shake your head.#char$$826$$0$0#|
14700|According to the merchant, the very first Water Dragon King possessed a scepter thought to be the key to the kingdom. Unfortunately, it seems you're not the only one he's revealed this to.

Also, unfortunately, the merchant refuses to reveal any more. Seems you'll have to keep looking...|
14701|#&7$Traveling Merchant##br#
"Well, it all begins with the old legend... the legend of the Water Dragon Kingdom.#br#
 See, now, these watery dragonfolk have all kinds of lore behind them. It's said that#br# when the very first king—Ahumai—died, his people used some kind of crazy spell#br#
 to cloak their citadel, Rheutesia. Now the only way in is with Ahumai's old scepter."
 #npc$$4$$1$0#

#&7$Ukyo##br#
"That's it?" #M043090$Ukyo$4$$1$0#

#&7$Traveling Merchant##br#
"That's it!" The merchant nods, a crap-eating grin gracing his somewhat nauseating features.
 #npc$$4$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
  You ask him where you should go to find such a scepter.#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Traveling Merchant##br#
"No one can say, really. I mean, that things is centuries old! Belonged to the very first#br# Water Dragon King, after all, and even if someone DID find it, I highly doubt they'd#br# dare touch the thing. Anyway, that's all I know! I'm just a seller of information. By the way,#br#
 you're not the first folks I've sold this little piece o' lore too. Just thought you should know."  
    
   #npc$$4$$1$0#

#&7$Ukyo##br#
"...I could hazard a guess who THAT was..."#br#
 Ukyo spits on the ground, and you assume she's talking about the Copperheads. #M043090$Ukyo$821$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You ask the merchant where these other customers of his ran off to.#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Traveling Merchant##br#
"'Fraid I can't help you with that one! I mean, come on! You wouldn't want me to go#br# about revealing YOUR whereabouts all willy-nilly to other people, would you?"#npc$$4$$1$0#

#&7$Ukyo##br#
"Come on. Every second we spend with this nitwit, the more time we're wasting.#br# We'll find more clues if we search on our own." Ukyo takes off without another word.
   #M043090$Ukyo$351$$1$0#|
14702|...|
14703|#&7$%n%##br#
 All of a sudden, you spot Ukyo stiffen, and she comes to an abrupt stop.#br# You ask her what's the matter.#char$$301$$0$0#

#&7$Ukyo##br#
"These statues..."#br#
 Her eyes are focused upwards, shifting from right to left and back again. #M043090$Ukyo$4$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You follow her gaze and see that there are, indeed, a number of giant statues#br# to your either side. It's almost as if they're defending something.#char$$2$$0$0#|
14710|Just as you're trying to make heads or tails of this new information, you hear a rustling from the bush in front of you!

Go check it out!|
14711|#&7$%n%##br#
 Just as you're taking in the suspicious grandeur of the stands, you hear a mighty#br#rustling from the bush in front of you.#char$$1$$0$0#

#&7$Ukyo##br#
"...there's something there." #M043090$Ukyo$4$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You warrant it's probably just a rabbit or squirrel, but decide to go investigate anyway.#char$$301$$0$0#|
14712|...|
14713|#&7$%n%##br#
 You hand the herbs over to Ukyo.#char$$1$$0$0#

#&7$Ukyo##br#
"These probably won't go very far..." Ukyo's eyes narrow as she squeezes#br#
 the juice from the herbs and mixes it with a potion from her pack. #M043090$Ukyo$1$$1$0#|
14714|#&7$Old Drakeling##br#
"H-... humans..." The old drakeling passes out before he can say another word.
   #M702021$Old Drakeling$502$$1$0#

#&7$Ukyo##br#
"He's badly hurt. We need something to treat his wounds.#br# %n%, get me some herbs? I can try to fashion a sort of rudimentary#br#
 salve with some of the materials I brought with me." #M043090$Ukyo$4$$1$0#|
14720|The old drakeling slowly opens his eyes, then lets out a rattling cough.|
14721|#&7$Ukyo##br#
"That should do." Carefully hoisting him into her lap, Ukyo tips a vile of#br#
 potion up against his lips until he begins to drink of it. #M043090$Ukyo$1$$1$0#

#&7$Old Drakeling##br#
The old drakeling gives another cough that rattles his whole body, then#br#
 glances to his right and left, seemingly confused. #M702021$Old Drakeling$502$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You ask him what happened and how he came to lie here.#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Old Drakeling##br#
"I-... I know nothing of a-... a scepter... P-please don't... don't make me..."#br# The drakeling's attitude changes almost instantly, and fear fills his eyes.
  
   #M702021$Old Drakeling$502$$1$0#|
14722|...|
14723|#&7$Ukyo##br#
"We're not gonna hurt you, old man. Just tell us what happened."#br# Despite Ukyo's lack of tact, the old drakeling seems to calm down.
   #M043090$Ukyo$4$$1$0#

#&7$Gogen##br#
"My name is... Gogen. Every year upon this day, I... go to the altar to...#br# pray for my village... but this year–! This year... a group of humans ambushed#br#
 me... asked me questions about some scepter..." Gogen's voice cracks.
   #M702021$Gogen$502$$1$0#

#&7$Ukyo##br#
"You don't think it could be...?" Ukyo glances over at you.
   #M043090$Ukyo$4$$1$0#|
14730|Gogen informs you that the entrance to the altar is at the other end of the bridge next to some sort of sculpture.

Go check it out for yourself and see if you can't find your way in.|
14731|#&7$%n%##br#
You ask Gogen where exactly the altar is located.#M702021$$502$$1$0#

#&7$Gogen##br#
"Near the sculpture at the... other end of the bridge, there's a... there's a..."#br#
 Gogen's eye bug out of his head, he lets out a wheezing gasp, then his body#br#shudders and he abruptly and ill-fatedly dies. #M702021$Gogen$502$$1$0#

#&7$Ukyo##br#
"Well. There goes that. But at least we have an idea which direction to go now.#br# Come on. They can't be too far ahead of us." Ukyo lets Gogen's body flop to the ground.
   #M043090$Ukyo$4$$1$0#|
14732|...|
14733|#&7$Ukyo##br#
"Hm... these gnashers are carrying the same markings as those lurkers we saw before.#br#
 And yet, strangely enough, the core of the charm already seems to be broken."#br#
 Ukyo taps her chin as she looks down at the gnasher carcasses. #M043090$Ukyo$4$$1$0#|
14734|Go to the end of the bridge|
14740|You notice the charms on the monsters you've killed already seem to have been broken. Upon taking a look at where the carcasses are lying, though, you deduce that there must be a path behind the sculpture.

Go to the altar|
14741|#&7$%n%##br#
 You take a gander up ahead and see some sort of sculpture up ahead. No doubt, this is the#br#sculpture that Gogen had tried to inform you of in his dying breath.#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Ukyo##br#
"Hm. Look at where those gnashers are grouped, yeah? I'd hazard a guess that there's a#br# path back there. It just seems so strange, though—why would the Copperheads want#br#
 to remove their own charms? It just doesn't make any sense. You don't suppose someone#br# ELSE could be here, too, do you?"
   #M043090$Ukyo$4$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You decide to get to the bottom of it.#char$$4$$0$0#|
14742|...|
14743|#&7$%n%##br#
 You mention that the Thundyvern also showed signs of being under some sort of charm.#br#
 Once the barrier brings them under control, the gnashers are able to slip free from their bindings.#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Ukyo##br#
"This barrier..." Ukyo's eyes narrow, and she stares wordlessly at the Thundyvern's remains.
   #M043090$Ukyo$1$$1$0#|
14750|You hear voices up ahead. 

Make your way closer to the altar without being seen and see if you can't identify the source of said voices.|
14751|#&7$%n%##br#
 You ask Tiya if she's found anything.#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Ukyo##br#
"Hm? Ah. No, sorry. Zoned out for a second there."#br# Ukyo shakes her head to clear her thoughts.
   #M043090$Ukyo$4$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 All of a sudden, you hear voices from above. Somebody's here!#br# You warn Ukyo to be quiet, and the two of you make for the shadows.#char$$4$$0$0#|
14752|...|
14753|#&7$Ukyo##br#
"..." You glance over at Ukyo and catch the strangest of looks on her features.
    #M043090$Ukyo$1$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You admit, you weren't exactly expecting to see THIS bunch again.#br# They couldn't possibly be looking for the scepter, too, could they?#char$$4$$0$0#|
14754|Twilight Vigil Society Activity|
14755|Grandmaster... Wh-... what is...?|
14756|Soraka... ray... procida...|
14757|Hahaha... So that's it!|
14758|Wh-what on earth?!|
14760|Turns out those voices you heard belong to none other than that mysterious group of masked gentlefolk you met up on Stygian Peak. Better see what they're up to!|
14761|#&7$Ukyo##br#
"Let's go take a look at that altar." Ukyo takes a bold step towards the altar in question.
   #M043090$Ukyo$351$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You hesitate a moment, then follow behind and begin checking the altar for#br#any information on the scepter.#char$$4$$0$0#|
14762|#&7$Ukyo##br#
"..." Ukyo looks a bit distracted.
    #M043090$Ukyo$1$$1$0#|
14763|#&7$%n%##br#
 You relay your findings—a bunch of symbols you can't decipher. You're unsure how to proceed.#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Ukyo##br#
"Pretty lackluster on my end, too. Hmm..." #M043090$Ukyo$4$$1$0#|
14770|Ukyo abruptly suggests you split up and follow the mysterious group.

Once you collect your bearings, you decide doing a bit of investigation into this mysterious group seems like the best course of action. Let Ukyo do her own thing! Lyrie had mentioned a small merchant village that shouldn't be too far. Why not check it out?|
14771|#&7$%n%##br#
 You go back and forth in your head a few times, but finally ask Ukyo what's up.#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Ukyo##br#
"Huh? No, really. It's nothing. Stop worrying so much, geez! I was just wondering#br# what that group is up too, is all. I mean, it's pretty suspicious if you ask me. Plus,#br# there was that light earlier..." Her eyes narrow.  
 #M043090$Ukyo$4$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Thinking back yourself, you recall that their leader seemed to have come to some#br#sort of realization after that same light.#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Ukyo##br#
"Let's split up."#br#
 Without even waiting for a reply, Ukyo launches off in the direction of the group. #M043090$Ukyo$4$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You're shocked! Appalled! Gloppened! How could Ukyo just ditch you like that?!#br#
 Still, though, you know you can't forget the mission. These people were powerful enough#br# to dispel the Copperheads' charms. You think it would be best to get a little more#br#
 information before you go charging after them like a bat out of hell.
 #char$$823$$0$0#|
14772|...|
14773|#&7$Lester##br#
"Hey! Hey, you! Yeah! I'm talkin' to you! You're one asking all those questions about#br# the Water Dragon Kingdom, right?" All of a sudden, one of the merchants calls out#br# to you and begins making his way over.
 #npc$$351$$1$0#|
14774|#&7$Noam##br#
"Wait! So, you... already know? Then I suppose I won't keep you in suspense, yeah?#br# You already know just about as much as me about the Water Dragon Kingdom.#br#
 I've lived in this village my whole life, and not I or anyone else has ever seen a#br#
 water Dragomon. Well, aside from those savages in the ruins, I mean."
 #npc$$4$$1$0#|
14775|#&7$Lambent##br#
"You know just as much as I, I'm afraid. That scepter is, indeed, the key to the Water#br#
 Dragon Kingdom, if the rumors are to be believed, but who knows WHERE the rumors#br#
 started. I'm normally not one to be taken in by such malarkey as that."#npc$$4$$1$0#|
14776|#&7$Angie##br#
"As far as I know, that's pretty much it. What you said, I mean. Then again, I can#br#
 only confirm what I've heard on the grapevine. That scepter DOES exist as far as I#br#know... but no one knows what happened to it."#npc$$4$$1$0#|
14780|You need something to exchange for information, and what better currency than blood?! Go get some from those Scythopods.

Time to make like a mosquito.|
14781|#&7$Lester##br#
"My apologies! I haven't even introduced myself. Name's Lester, and I just so might#br# happen to have some of that information you're so desperately seeking. It's not cheap,#br#
 though—good information never is, if you catch my drift—so I guess it'll all depend#br#
 on how much you're willing to cough up..." Lester rubs his hands together.
 #npc$$4$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You sigh. This again? You've had it up to HERE with moneygrubbing scammers#br#
 only out to make a quick buck. You inform Lester that you're clean out of things to trade.#char$$826$$0$0#

#&7$Lester##br#
Lester ponders this for a moment. "All right, then. How about this? You see those#br# Scythopods that like to wonder about outside the village? Seems their blood boasts#br#
 some kinda mysterious properties, yeah? I'd REALLY love some... but those things#br#
 are a bi-... I mean, they're quite strong, ahaha, so, uh... if you could maybe get some..."
  
  
 #npc$$4$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You shrug your shoulders. You're pretty used to being people's personal swineherd by#br#this point. You make him promise, however, that this is the ONLY thing you have to do#br#for him to relinquish the information.#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Lester##br#
"Ahahaha, perish the thought! I would never DREAM of it..." Lester laughs somewhat#br# nervously, and you can't help but think he'd been planning to do exactly that.  
 #npc$$4$$1$0#|
14782|#&7$Lester##br#
"No other blood will do! It's gotta be Scythopod blood!" Lester waggles his finger.#br# "And don't try to pull the wool over my eyes or anything. I know the blood of a#br#
 pod when I see it!"#npc$$4$$1$0#|
14783|#&7$%n%##br#
 You hand Lester the Scythopod blood.#char$$1$$0$0#

#&7$Lester##br#
"Wowie! That was pretty quick! Gotta hand it to you. Now, lemme see, lemme see..."#br# Lester scrutinizes the bottle in his hand, turning it over and over.
 #npc$$4$$1$0#

#&7$Lester##br#
"Holy cripes! This is the real deal! Y-... you must be some kind of steroid-injected#br# mutated humanoid robot!" Lester's pupils quiver in disbelief.
 #npc$$823$$1$0#
|
14790|Right in the middle of listening to the sultry sound of your hard-earned information, you hear a clamor outside, and Lester races out to see what's the matter. Guess you've got no choice but to follow him.|
14791|#&7$%n%##br#
 You ask (exceedingly politely, of course) if he can tell you the information now.#char$$1$$0$0#

#&7$Lester##br#
"'Course! 'Course! I'm a man of my word, am I not? Now then, listen real close-like.#br#
 Some long time ago, a group of people ventured deep, deep into the ruins, yeah? So#br#
 deep, in fact, that they started feeling this strange kinda mystical energy-..." All#br#
 of a sudden, frenzied shouting from outside the village interrupts Lester's story.#npc$$4$$1$0#

#&7$Lester##br#
"Huh? Whazzat?! Some kinda fight? Oh, man! Could something have happened#br# with the Trade Delegation?" Lester's eyes shine wild with a mixture of excitement#br# and horror, and he immediately takes off for the village entrance.
 #npc$$301$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 He hasn't even finished telling you what he knows! That... that... that-...!!#br# Barely able to contain your rage, you unclench your fingers and dash forward to catch up.#char$$1$$0$0#|
14792|...|
14793|#&7$Lester##br#
"A... a village from the ruins?! My god!" You find Lester kneeling not far from the#br#
 injured body of a drakeling. The rest of the villagers are all standing around in a circle,#br#voices loud as they bicker and argue amongst themselves.#npc$$823$$1$0#|
14800|Seems the villagers are all discussing one thing—the injured drakeling! Lester explains, though, that he's a villager from the ruins, which means you shouldn't get too close...|
14801|#&7$%n%##br#
 You can see right away that the drakeling is badly injured; however, no one from#br#
 the surrounding peanut gallery seems keen on helping him.#char$$1$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You tell Lester that someone needs to help the poor man.#char$$1$$0$0#

#&7$Lester##br#
"But... but he's from the ruins, man! The ruins! Don't get too close to him!"#br# Lester holds his hand out in case you were thinking of doing just that.
 #npc$$4$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Lester is obviously unwilling to help the drakeling, so it seems you'll need to look for aid elsewhere.#char$$1$$0$0#|
14802|#&7$Lester##br#
 Lester looks at the drakeling on the ground in disgust.#npc$$1$$1$0#|
14803|#&7$Lester##br#
"You wanna know why no one wants to help these savages? I'll tell you why! They#br#
 took everything! All the resources in the ruins! And they HATE outsiders. That#br#
 story I was telling you earlier? About the group that went into the ruins? It was THESE#br#
 savages that seriously effed them up, if you know what I mean." Lester's eyes darken. #npc$$4$$1$0#|
14804|#&7$Onlooker##br#
"Hey! What're you doin'? You crazy? You don't actually wanna HELP these savages,#br# do you? You better stay away from them if you know what's good for you!"
 #npc$$4$$1$0#|
14805|#&7$Onlooker##br#
"Ha! You wanna HELP that savage? You're gonna have to do it yourself! No one HERE'S#br#
 gonna help you. Would be a complete waste of supplies!"#npc$$4$$1$0#|
14810|Lester thinks he can make a medicine from the Scythopod blood, but he's missing salt crystals—a key ingredient. Guess it's up to you again to save the day!

Find some water and see if you can't gather up some salt crystals.|
14811|#&7$%n%##br#
 You insist that letting him just lie there and die would be beyond cruel!#br#You ask Lester what kind of medicine can be used to heal him.#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Lester##br#
"You're really not gonna give up, are you?" Lester sighs, but you can see his reluctance#br# fading. "All right, all right. I suppose there WOULD be trouble if we just let him die here.#br#
 I can make something using that Scythopod blood, but there are a few more ingredients#br#
 I'll need. Also, you have to agree to cart him away from here once I'm done, you hear?"
  
  
 #npc$$4$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You ask what ingredients are missing—you'll get them pronto!#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Lester##br#
"Salt, actually. There's tons of it in the wetlands near here. I can mix it with the blood#br#
 and make a rudimentary medicine. That area's dangerous, though. Full of all kinds#br# of big baddies that'd sooner rip your head off than say hello. You really wanna risk#br#
 your life like that?" #npc$$4$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You say you've risked it for less before and that you'll be back straightaway with the salt crystals.#char$$4$$0$0#|
14812|#&7$Lester##br#
"It's your life! Do whatever you want!" Lester shakes his head with a helpless sigh.
 #npc$$4$$1$0#|
14813|#&7$%n%##br#
 You hand Lester the salt crystals, and he starts mixing the potion.#char$$1$$0$0#|
14820|Lester finishes the medicine and asks you to treat the poor drakeling yourself.

You better hurry up, too, or else you'll be writing him a eulogy instead!|
14821|#&7$Lester##br#
"Well, that should about do it, then! One potion, comin' right up!"#br#
 Lester hands you the finished potion, and you take it carefully.#npc$$4$$1$0#

#&7$Lester##br#
"You're the one who wants to save him, so you're gonna have to administer it#br#
 yourself, though I assume you already figured that. Don't come cryin' to us if#br#
 anything happens! We DID warn you!" Lester waggles his finger.#npc$$4$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You take the potion and thank Lester, then head off to help the poor, injured drakeling.#char$$4$$0$0#|
14822|#&7$Lester##br#
"Ha, don't thank me! Was nothing more than a trade.#br# Don't forget your promise—get him out of here once you're done!"#npc$$4$$1$0#|
14823|#&7$Injured Villager##br#
"Ngh... wh-... where... am I?"#br#
 The drakeling slowly comes to, his eyes fluttering open.#npc$$503$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You tell him he's in the drakeling merchant village, then inquire as to what he's doing here.#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Injured Villager##br#
"The... merchant village?" He blinks and glances about. "I-... I must have gone the#br# wrong way... I was hurt and-... wasn't thinking clearly... I never thought the people#br#
 here would save me, though..."
 #npc$$102$$1$0#

#&7$Lester##br#
"HA! And we never WOULD have either, if it hadn't been for this human!#br# Like we would ever want to waste our resources on you! Just get lost already!"
  
   #M402023$Lester$4$$1$0#

#&7$Injured Villager##br#
"I-... ngh! I shouldn't have let my guard down. Then those Scythopods wouldn't have#br#
 been able to... ngh! Ambush me..." You can tell it pains him to speak.#npc$$102$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 With a wave of your hands, you tell him not to move, then turn back to Lester and ask for#br#a bit more time so that he might fully recover.#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Lester##br#
"As if! We already fulfilled OUR end of the bargain. Now YOU fulfill YOURS and#br# get him out of here! I don't remember anything saying he needed to recover first!"
   #M402023$Lester$825$$0$0#

#&7$Injured Villager##br#
"If you-... want me to go, I'll-... ngh! I'll go... Just-... just give me a second..."#br# The injured drakeling pushes himself to his feet, but he can barely even stand.
 #npc$$1$$1$0#|
14824|Treat the injured drakeling with the medicine|
14830|Ven Gram asks you to bring him some juicy, succulent Hardrock Aerodillo meat. Eat fresh!

See if you can find any unsuspecting varmints scuffling about nearby.|
14831|#&7$%n%##br#
 Afraid he's going to collapse again, you rush forward and help keep him steady.#char$$1$$0$0#

#&7$Ven Gram##br#
"I-... apologize, human. For causing you all this... trouble. I should be able to...#br# to walk on my own from here—really..." He manages a somewhat pathetic smile.#br# "Thank you for-... everything you've done. My name is Ven. Ven Gram. I'm a#br#
 hunter down in the ruins..." #npc$$102$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You refuse to just leave him like this (and you tell him so quite adamantly).#br#Besides—you add—you have something you need to ask him anyway.#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Ven Gram##br#
"Well... I suppose I could let you come, but could I ask you for a-... ngh, small favor?#br#
 I wasn't able to hunt the meat I set out to bring back because of my injuries. You don't#br#
 suppose you could-... ngh, collect some Hardrock Aerodillo meat for me, could you?"#npc$$302$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You bid farewell to Lester and follow Ven outside the village.#char$$4$$0$0#|
14832|#&7$Ven Gram##br#
 Collecting the meat shouldn't be too difficult, so you agree to help.#br#You're feeling a bit peckish yourself, anyway...#npc$$1$$1$0#|
14833|#&7$%n%##br#
 You hand the meat over to Ven, then ask him for more information on the ruins#br#and those who live there.#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Ven Gram##br#
"You mean someone out there actually gives a damn? Haha!" Ven laughs to himself.#br# "Color me surprised, though I can't say we're all that interesting. We're just your average,#br# everyday drakelings who happen to live in a village down in the ruins. Not really much#br#
 special about us OR our home if you ask me."
 #npc$$4$$1$0#

#&7$Ven Gram##br#
"It is true, though—what a lot of them say about us. We're not exactly the most welcoming#br# to foreigners, but that's only, well... it's only because there are certain areas in the ruins#br#
 we simply can't allow anyone to enter, so to speak."#npc$$4$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Curious, you ask what's in these "forbidden areas" and why people would be so keen#br#on trying to get inside in the first place.#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Ven Gram##br#
"You think I'd tell you? You're a funny kid, you know that?" Ven laughs again. "They're#br#
 forbidden for a reason—just know that."#npc$$4$$1$0#|
14840|Seems Ven lives just up ahead. Hurry it up already! |
14841|#&7$%n%##br#
 You walk with him for a while longer and notice that Ven's already looking in#br#considerably better shape.#char$$1$$0$0#

#&7$Ven Gram##br#
"Our camp's not much further. Certain people are probably worried sick already,#br# so we should step up the pace a bit." Ven points ahead, and you see what appears#br#
 to be a small village in the distance.#npc$$351$$1$0#|
14842|#&7$Ven Gram##br#
"As for your presence, I wouldn't worry too much. CERTAIN people shouldn't give you any#br#trouble as far as I know... so long as you don't mention, you know, forbidden areas and all that."#npc$$4$$1$0#|
14843|#&7$Ven Gram##br#
"Hey, old man! I'm back!"#br#
 Ven heads straight towards a middle-aged gentleman towards the front of the tent. #M306080$Ven Gram$822$$0$0#

#&7$Chieftain##br#
"YOU!" The drakeling turns around in a fury. "How many times have I TOLD you#br# to stop calling me that! I'm the chieftain here, you know! I deserve some respect!#br# Besides, what took you so long, hm? Was ALMOST about to get worried. Not that#br#
 I ever get worried, that is." The chief's eyes suddenly shift from Ven to you.  
 #npc$$825$$1$0#

#&7$Ven Gram##br#
"Ah, right. Allow me to introduce you, hm? This is %n%. I ran into a little, erm,#br# trouble while out hunting, and they lent me a gracious hand..." Ven goes into further#br#
 detail about what transpired outside the merchant village.
   #M306080$Ven Gram$822$$0$0#

#&7$Festus##br#
"Hmm... well, I suppose I should, indeed, thank you for saving this brat's life,#br# though he practically doesn't deserve it." Festus gives Ven's ear a rather sharp yank.#br# 
 "However, even he knows the golden rule around here—no foreigners allowed. I'll#br#
 allow you to rest here for a while, but then I'll have to ask you to leave this place."
 #npc$$4$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Taking a look around the village, you notice everyone seems to be in fervent preparation#br#for something or another. You ask Ven if there's a reason for the busy activity.#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Ven Gram##br#
"Ah, we're holding a ceremony tomorrow. A pretty important one, too—it's only held once a#br#
 year. That's probably another reason why the old man wants you gone so soon. This ceremony,#br#
 well, it DOES involve the 'forbidden area' that I, of course, can't tell you about, so..." #M306080$Ven Gram$4$$1$0#|
14850|Norris seems to think ceremonial incense will cure Ven's affliction. You're not sure how, but you agree to help him all the same.

Accompany Ven Gram to Norris's home.|
14851|#&7$Festus##br#
"Oh, right! Brat! Norris is looking for you. Practically slipped my mind. You didn't#br#
 agree to help him or something, did you?" Festus calls out as the two of your prepare#br#
 to leave the tent.#npc$$4$$1$0#

#&7$Ven Gram##br#
"Damn it all! I completely forgot. I promised Norris I'd bring him back some incense#br# for the ceremony." Ven continues to curse beneath his breath. "NOW how am I supposed#br#
 to get him any?" His hand goes instinctively to his bunged-up arm.
   #M306080$Ven Gram$826$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Always happy to be of assistance, you ask if you might collect it in Ven's stead.#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Festus##br#
"Perish the thought! This is something that only one of our own can take care of,#br#
 THAT I can assure you. I'll just find someone e-..." Before he can finish speaking,#br#Ven interrupts him.#npc$$4$$1$0#|
14852|#&7$Festus##br#
"The brat really seems to trust you, but don't think that applies to everyone just yet.#br#
 I catch you snooping around, and you'll quickly find me much less polite!"#npc$$4$$1$0#|
14853|#&7$Ven Gram##br#
"Heeeeeey, Norris... 'fraid I've got a bit of bad news..." #M306080$Ven Gram$4$$0$0#|
14854|#&7$Ven Gram##br#
"Come on, old man! That racist side of you rearing its ugly head again?#br# I mean, we're already short on manpower, and we really DO need that#br#
 incense. I'm pretty sure it wouldn't hurt anything to let %n% help."#npc$$4$$1$0#

#&7$Festus##br#
"And who gave YOU permission to talk, Mr. I-Had-To-Go-And-Injure-Myself, hm?#br#
 I just..." Festus turns away for a moment, then glances back towards you to give you#br# a second once-over. "I don't know, but... fine. FINE! But YOU need to keep an eye#br#
  on him, brat. Don't make me regret this decision!"
   #M308080$Festus$4$$1$0#|
14860|What better ingredient for incense than cat musk? It works every time.

Hunt yourself some Ferelmoon Lynxes for some o' that musk!|
14861|#&7$Norris##br#
"Heh, look at YOU! Shave with a piece of glass again?" Norris chuckles to himself,#br# but he stops when he sees you. "Well, I'll be! A new face! Doesn't happen often around#br#
 here. Who's your new friend?"  
 #npc$$4$$1$0#

#&7$Ven Gram##br#
"Well, you see..." Ven scratches the back of his head as he goes into detail about what happened.
   #M306080$Ven Gram$4$$0$0#

#&7$Ven Gram##br#
"That about sums it up. Which is why %n% is gonna help us out for a bit." #M306080$Ven Gram$4$$0$0#

#&7$Norris##br#
"Haha! You must have SOME skills then! Ven's no shy chicken when it comes#br# to besting those baddies out there, yet look what those Scythopods did to 'im!#br#
 I'm sure you'll be MOST helpful to our little operation..." Norris gives your#br# shoulder a quick shake. "You go ahead and go get some rest, Ven."
 #npc$$4$$1$0#

#&7$Ven Gram##br#
"Well, %n%? Looks like it's all up to you now!" #M306080$Ven Gram$4$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You tell Ven to get better soon, and he takes his leave.#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Norris##br#
"Right. Anyway, we don't have a lot of time left, so we're gonna need to be quick#br# about this thing. I need some Feremoon Lynx musk in order to make the incense for#br#
 our ceremony. Don't underestimate those tykes, though! They may look like a bunch#br# of kitty-cats, but they'll scratch your eyes out soon as they get the opportunity!"
  
 #npc$$4$$1$0#|
14862|#&7$Norris##br#
 Norris looks busy preparing his tools for the upcoming incense manufacturing.#br# Better go get that Ferelmoon Lynx musk for him!#npc$$1$$1$0#|
14863|#&7$%n%##br#
 You hand Norris the musk.#char$$1$$0$0#

#&7$Norris##br#
"Ohoho! You're MUST faster than Ven! Now I guess I know how lazy he really is."#br# Norris grabs the flask of musk and pours it into another containing before slowly#br#
 mixing it with a spoon, humming under his breath.#npc$$4$$1$0#|
14870|As if cat musk weren't enough, now you need to collect some maloron grass. Lovely.

Head to the northern region of the ruins and gather some of that hemp.|
14871|#&7$Norris##br#
"Ah, right. I'd actually wanted to tell you to bring back some maloron grass on your#br#
 way back, but I forgot. You're back so soon, though, would you mind too much#br#
 running back out and nabbing some? Would give me some more time to get this#br#
 prepared anyway..." Norris's eyes practically cross as he examines the musk.
 #npc$$4$$1$0#|
14872|#&7$Norris##br#
 Norris looks pretty intent on that musk. Best to let him alone for now.|
14873|#&7$%n%##br#
 You hand Norris the tufts of maloron grass.#char$$1$$0$0#

#&7$Norris##br#
"H-holy cripes! How did you manage to get this much? I just-... wowza! I'd forget#br# you were human if it wasn't quite so obvious. This grass grows pretty close to those,#br#
 erm, 'off-limit' areas where a bunch of really nasty critters like to prowl. Good thing#br#
 you didn't ACTUALLY go in, though, am I right? Festus woulda have a field day."
 #npc$$4$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Exasperated, you say that this is probably the kind of thing he should have told you before you left.#char$$826$$0$0#|
14880|Stop everything! Norris needs you to go help Festus, ASAP!|
14881|#&7$Norris##br#
"Yeah, you're probably right, but hey! No harm, no foul. At any rate, this should be#br# everything I need for now. It'll take me a bit to finish it, though, so why don't you#br#
 go check in with Ven? Who knows—Festus might give him an earful if he notices#br#you're not together."#npc$$4$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Probably a good idea, you suppose, but before you leave, you take the opportunity to#br#quietly ask Norris about the mysterious energy Lester had mentioned in story earlier.#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Norris##br#
"Mysterious energy? HAHA! What are you talking about? We've got plenty of mystery#br# here—THAT, I can assure you of—but energy? Nah. Afraid I can't tell you much more,#br#
 though, or it'll be ME that gets an earful from the old man." Norris shoots you a wink.
 #npc$$4$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Wracking your brain for a way to get even a little more information out of these people,#br#you finally decide to reveal you're looking for clues as to the whereabouts of Ahumai's#br#scepter and the Water Dragon Kingdom.#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Norris##br#
"Scepter? Water Dragon Kingdom? Sorry—can't say I've ever heard anything about#br# either of those. Maybe one of those merchants lied to you or something. They tend to do#br# that, you know—they're only after our crystals so they can fill their own pockets. You've#br#
 probably noticed already, but this whole place is surrounded by ancient crystal ruins..."
    
  
 #npc$$4$$1$0#

#&7$Norris##br#
"One day a year, the moon moves into orbit and shines down perfectly on all those ruins.#br# It's quite the sight! The old man says this is when our ancestors come down to celebrate#br# with us, so we hold a ceremony and read verses in the light of all those crystals." Norris#br#
 pauses a moment. "Oh, crap! I shouldn't have said that! Anyway, go find Ven, yeah?"
    
 #br#|
14882|#&7$%n%##br#
 Go and meet with Festus first.#char$$1$$0$0#|
14883|#&7$Ven Gram##br#
"Hey, old man! You wanted to see me?" #M306080$Ven Gram$4$$0$0#

#&7$Festus##br#
"Yes! I've been looking for you all day, brat! I wanted to ask you something very#br#
 important! You didn't happen to see the deacon while you were out and about#br#
 getting yourself injured, did you? He's been gone for some time now..."#npc$$4$$1$0#

#&7$Ven Gram##br#
"The deacon? Can't say I did. Though, I'll admit I wasn't exactly looking for him, so...#br# Was too busy keeping my eyes peeled for prey on the way out, and was a little bit#br#
 distracted on the way back, as you can imagine..." Ven rubs his chin in thought.
   #M306080$Ven Gram$4$$0$0#

#&7$Festus##br#
"Odd. Very odd. You don't suppose something could have happened at the#br# altar, do you...?" Festus's brows furrow in worry.#npc$$4$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 All of a sudden, you remember the old drakeling you'd found earlier, and quickly relay as such.#char$$1$$0$0#

#&7$Ven Gram##br#
"Wh-what?! No! Deacon Gogen? I-it can't be!" Ven's eyes widen like twin saucers.  
   #M306080$Ven Gram$823$$0$0#

#&7$Festus##br#
"This is... this is a tragedy. To think it could have come to this..." Festus shakes his#br#
 head morosely. "That poor man... and all because of some foolish rumors!"#npc$$4$$1$0#|
14884|#&7$Ven Gram##br#
"Whew! You're back! I was just about to head over and see the old man, but suddenly#br# got worried he'd let me have it if you weren't there with me when I went. No problem#br#
 now, though!" Ven grabs your hand with a grin and drags you towards Festus's tent.
 #npc$$351$$1$0#|
14890|Apparently, a suspicious group of people has been seen on their way to the altar! This can only mean bad things. Festus asks you to hightail it over there and see what's up.|
14891|#&7$%n%##br#
 Just as you're about to ask more about this "altar," one of the villagers comes running over.#char$$1$$0$0#

#&7$Villager##br#
"Ch-chief! We've got intruders! They appeared outta nowhere! A-and it looks like they're#br# heading straight for the deadlands!" The villager seems a bit verklempt.
   #M326051$Villager$825$$1$0#

#&7$Festus##br#
"Bastards. They really don't know when to give up, do they?" Festus's face hardens#br# instantly. "You! Come with me! We're going to put a stop to this once and for all."#br# Festus beckons a group of villagers towards him, and they storm out of the village.
  #npc$$4$$1$0#

#&7$Ven Gram##br#
"Seems like some merchants aren't afraid to die, these days. HA!" Ven punches#br#
 his fist into his palm, perhaps a bit more excited than he ought to be.
   #M306080$Ven Gram$4$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You volunteer to tag along and help—if it really is the merchants, you might be#br#able to persuade them to leave.#char$$1$$0$0#|
14892|...|
14893|#&7$%n%##br#
 You're shocked to hear that Festus and the other villagers were attacked just outside#br#this "forbidden area." You hurry over to make sure they're all right.#npc$$503$$1$0#

#&7$Festus##br#
"H-... humans! Those foul beings are nothing but... d-dirty humans! The lot of them!#br# What's your angle, human?" You can tell even in his weakened state that Festus is#br#
 overcome with rage. His eyes are practically blazing.#npc$$503$$1$0#|
14900|Why, if it isn't your friends from before! "Friends" being used loosely, of course. What's worse—they're keen on touching all them Crystal Clusters. Put a stop to that touch!|
14901|#&7$%n%##br#
 Humans?! Then... it's that mysterious group you ran into before! You relay to#br#Festus everything you know about them.#npc$$503$$1$0#

#&7$Festus##br#
"Their goal must be none other than the... great crystal cluster! It is the largest piece of#br# crystal left behind by our ancestors. Normally, the deadlands are protected by a kind of#br#
 energy, I-... I don't know why those humans aren't affected by it..."#npc$$503$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You ask for more information about this energy.#char$$1$$0$0#

#&7$Festus##br#
"We've long forbidden outsiders from entering the Crystal Deadlands not only because#br#
 of our ancestral relics, but also because of this energy. It somehow... affects your mind.#br#
 Delve too deep, and not even drakelings can control themselves any longer. Could it be,#br#though, that humans aren't affected by this energy...?"#npc$$503$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Immediately upon hearing this, you think back to the battle of Stygian Peak—the#br# energy there hadn't affected humans either. Perhaps the energy here is the same?#char$$823$$0$0#

#&7$Festus##br#
"I-... I'm ashamed to ask this, but could you help us, human? I fear you're the only#br# one who can do anything for us at this rate. You cannot let them touch the relics!"#npc$$503$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You nod in understanding and rush off in the direction of the deadlands.|
14902|...|
14903|#&7$Ukyo##br#
"Well, that was stupid..."#br#
 Ukyo pushes herself to her feet with a grunt.#npc$$102$$1$0#|
14904|Go deeper into the ruins|
14905|Catch up with the invaders|
14906|Break through the cult's circle|
14910|Those sons of snakes! The Copperheads have slithered off with the scepter! Swipe that scepter back from those shifty swindlers pronto!|
14911|#&7$%n%##br#
 You ask Ukyo what's going on.#char$$301$$0$0#

#&7$Ukyo##br#
"Talk? We don't have time to talk! The Copperheads stole the scepter!#br#
 We've gotta get it back from them before it's too late!" Ukyo shouts before#br# taking off for the deadlands depths.
 #npc$$301$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 It seems like everything is spiraling out of control. You don't even know what's#br#happening anymore! Seems like you've got no choice but to simply follow along.#char$$301$$0$0#|
14912|...|
14913|#&7$Ukyo##br#
"Cripes almighty!" Ukyo wipes the sweat from her forehead. "It should be safe here..."
  
 #npc$$102$$1$0#|
14914|Now, now! There's no need to hide. Come on out and play!|
14915|And here I thought I'd be lucky enough to never see your face again, Fritz.|
14916|Just what kind of tripe are you and your flunkies trying to pull now, huh?|
14917|Oh, nothing YOU need concern yourself with, I'd imagine.|
14918|You really thought you could escape?|
14919|What fools...|
14920|What? The Water Dragon Kingdom no longer exists?! If you want more information, you'll need to ask that drakeling by the seal...|
14921|#&7$%n%##br#
 Quite lost, you ask Ukyo exactly who these people are.#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Ukyo##br#
"I-... I probably should have told you before, but no use crying over spilled milk.#br# They call themselves the Leadshale Rogues—I used to be one of them. One of their#br#
 best actually. And I used to be... close to their leader, Fritz. That's why I figured I'd#br#
 track them on my own, but I never dreamed they'd find the scepter!" Ukyo curses.
    
 #npc$$4$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You ask if the energy here is the same as the energy from the sanctuary on Stygian Peak.#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Ukyo##br#
"In a way, yes. But at the same time, well... the Water Dragon Kingdom, it-..." #npc$$4$$1$0#

#&7$Drakeling##br#
"It's gone." Ukyo's sentence is abruptly finished by one of the drakelings whom rescued you.
 #npc$$4$$1$0#|
14922|...|
14923|#&7$%n%##br#
 Dumbfounded, you ask the drakeling for more details.#char$$823$$0$0#

#&7$Drakeling##br#
"I'm not sure what kind of details you want—it's as I said. The kingdom is gone.#br# Look below you. Where you stand was once the capital of the Water Dragon Kingdom,#br#
 Rheutesia. But it has now become nothing more than dirt and dust." The drakeling's#br#
 eyes quiver with a sort of hesitant nostalgia.#npc$$4$$1$0#

#&7$Drakeling##br#
"Tell me, humans—why have you come here? Why have you broken the seal?"#br# His face is practically emotionless as he speaks.
 #npc$$1$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You explain to him why you're looking for the Water Dragon Kingdom, as well as#br#your unfinished business with the Shadow Dragon Army.#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Drakeling##br#
"I see." The drakeling's eyes seem to ebb and flow like an invisible tide. "It would seem#br# the past is inescapable after all, then. Though what still puzzles me is why Queen Ashar,#br#
 a fledgling queen, would choose to awaken now, of all times." His brows furrow as he#br#
 stares off at something in the distance.#npc$$1$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Even more curious about this man, now, you ask what exactly he's doing here, as well#br#
 as how an entire city could completely disappear just like that.#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Drakeling##br#
"My people used the last of their power to cast the seal which wiped the city from#br# existence. They sacrificed their power, their lives... everything, all in order to protect#br#
 King Ahumai and the legacy of the Water Dragon Kingdom. But in doing so, they#br#
 effectively killed off their entire race." The drakeling chuckles morosely, shaking his head.
 #npc$$1$$1$0#

#&7$Ukyo##br#
"Then... every single Water Dragon is... dead?" Ukyo's eyes widen momentarily#br# before narrowing in suspicion. "Wait a minute—how do YOU know so much?"
   #M043090$Ukyo$4$$1$0#

#&7$Sachiel##br#
"Why shouldn't I? After all, I AM the ruler of this once-great land. Sachiel Fheyl the#br# Third, at your service, though I'm not sure I should offer it considering it was you humans#br#
 who caused the great war that led to our demise so many years ago. So greedy for power,#br#
 to learn more of the arcane arts. It was them who attempted to break the great king's seal."
  
 #npc$$4$$1$0#

#&7$Sachiel##br#
"We locked down the city in an attempt to keep the humans out, but in doing so, subjected#br#
 ourselves to the full brunt of the seal's energy. Using His Majesty's scepter to cloak the#br#
 seal, we combined our magic and forged these crystals into which we stored both our#br#
 memories and the scepter. Now, however, someone has found a way to break the crystals..."
   #npc$$4$$1$0#|
14924|Master! Are you all right?|
14925|Never fear. I am unharmed. Be careful! He has come...|
14926|Fool! Give us the scepter!|
14927|If you want it so badly, come and get it!|
14928|Master! This is our only chance to break the seal! Let's go!|
14929|You shan't prevail!|
14930|Sachiel says he will appeal to the clan to stand with you against the evil Shadow Cabal in The Volcazar.|
14931|#&7$%n%##br#
 Your gaze shifts towards Ukyo.#char$$2$$0$0#

#&7$Ukyo##br#
"What're you looking at ME for?" Ukyo raises an eyebrow. "He and I are through!"
    #M043090$Ukyo$4$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You tell Sachiel it was none other than Fritz, the leader of the Leadshale Rogues, whom#br#
 broke the seal; however, at the moment he only seems keen on obtaining that scepter.#br#You're not sure what he plans on doing with it...#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Sachiel##br#
"You don't mean that mage in the mask, do you? Hm. Now that I think about it, I#br# HAVE seen that medal he was wearing before, and yet... it can't be! We wiped that#br#
 clan of humans out! How could any of them still be around today...?" Sachiel turns#br#
 away, his eyes icy.#npc$$4$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You have trouble containing your shock. The Leadshale Rogues were originally from...#br#Drachmar? But-! You quickly ask Ukyo if she knows anything about this.#char$$823$$0$0#

#&7$Ukyo##br#
"I-... I, well... I don't know, really... I mean, it all sounds like a big coincidence, but...#br# My sister and I, we-... we both grew up with the Rogues. She always HAD said the#br# organization itself should have ceased to have existed ages ago, but..." Her eyes#br#
 narrow, and you can see the confliction carved into her features.
   #M043090$Ukyo$4$$1$0#

#&7$Sachiel##br#
"Within that scepter are remnants of King Ahumai's power. It's one of my race's most#br# valuable treasures. We MUST think of a way to get it back. As for the seal, it's already too#br#
 late. Now that the crystals have been broken, the dragons' memories will begin to return#br#
 You should return to the Volcazar. I'll have my dragons guard the remains of the seal."
  
 #npc$$4$$1$0#|
14932|...|
14933|#&7$%n%##br#
 When you get back to the Volcazar, you find Pelt and Esh-Baal in discussion once more—#br#this time about the Water Dragon Kingdom. You head over straightaway to report what#br#you've learned.#char$$301$$0$0#|
14934|Master! Watch out!|
14935|Midori!|
14936|Ukyo... Fritz is here. You must know what this means, yes?|
14937|You've grown so strong...|
14938|I'd really prefer we weren't enemies. Wouldn't you agree, Midori?|
14939|Katya!!|
14940|You can't help but feel a little anxious about the upcoming confrontation with the Copperheads, so you pay a visit to your sometimes-counselor, Van Pelt.|
14941|#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"Well, I suppose that explains why our scouts could never find any traces of the Water Dragon#br# 
 Kingdom on their searches, then, yeah?" Pelt laughs to himself somewhat self-deprecatingly. #&7$Van Pelt##br#

#&7$Esh-Baal##br#
"I never would have thought a seal created by such an enormous sacrifice could be broken...#br#
 Ashkenaz has gone too far. To think they'd go to these lengths!" She shakes her head. "The#br#
 Water Dragon Kingdom may be gone, but their people live on as our allies. At least we#br#
 have one thing worth celebrating at the moment." #M360010$Esh-Baal$4$$1$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"What's worse is that a third player seems to have invited themselves to the game.#br#
 I'm not sure exactly what these Leadshale Rogues are up to, but we've gotta keep a#br#close eye on them from now on." Pelt looks pointedly at Ukyo. #&7$Van Pelt##br#

#&7$Ukyo##br#
"I have no idea WHAT their plan is! I mean, if all they wanted to do was destroy the#br#
 seal, why fight with the Copperheads? And then there's what Katya said..." Her eyes#br# glaze over for a moment, then she shakes her head. "I just... I don't know..."
   #M043090$Ukyo$4$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You report to Van Pelt that even more Copperhead officers have been spotted in Drachmar.#br#
 Worried about what this might mean, you ask if he has any insight into the matter.#char$$823$$0$0#|
14942|...|
14943|#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"The Copperheads? Heh. Well, the name 'Copperhead' pulls a lot more weight around#br# here than even some of the highest Falcon officers. Their guild master, Ulysses, is a brute,#br#
 but most of their affairs are handled by some voodoo witch named Kristal. Scary lot,#br#
 if you ask me, but the government seems to love 'em. Why do you ask?"  
    
   #&7$Van Pelt##br#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You respond that you hadn't really known about the relationship between all the guilds#br#in the region. It's been very eye-opening for you the last couple of months. As a side-note,#br#you ask Pelt if you're still doing a good job.#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"%n%, you're one of our most talented new hunters. That's the God's honest truth.#br#
 I don't know anything about your past or what you did before you joined the Falcons,#br# but what I do know is that so long as you're one of my Falcons, I would never... EVER#br#
 let you be threatened by some other guild or whatever, even if..." Pelt hesitates.
  
   #&7$Van Pelt##br#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You can see it in his eyes, in his expression, in the way the words tremble as they escape#br#his lips—Van Pelt is hiding something. Not wanting to bring up anything painful,#br#however, you decide not to pursue the matter further and simply thank him for all his help.#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"No sweat, squirt. You go get some rest, now, you hear? We'll wait for the rest of the#br# crew to get back, then figure out the best way to proceed from here, yeah? I can imagine#br#
 things'll only get tougher now that we're down to the last two seals, so you'll need to#br#
 be prepared." You notice his eyes shift towards Ukyo for just a moment before returning. #&7$Van Pelt##br#|
14944|Huh? Th-... the ground is shaking!|
14945|The altar, it's-...! It's gonna collapse!|
14946|I don't know what to say... Can we even get out of here alive? I'm not sure...|
14947|Hmm... Nothing too abnormal here.|
14948|What's wrong with the path here?|
14949|It's almost as if it's being... pressed down by something.|
14950|You learned from the head of the investigation is completed Agatha and Bane news, head to you with him and Agatha and Bane confluence exchanging intelligence.|
14951|#&7$%n%##br#
 Your usual, moving around in the fortress of Calatrava, to collect information on the Dragon on the continent more further information.
 Just as after the head side, you are the head stopped.#char$$821$$0$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"Yo!. I was ready to go How about you. Bane and Agatha investigation seems to finally come to an end, just before reaching the
 Calatrava fortress, and I go and join them now.   #M330090$Van Pelt$822$$1$0#|
14952|...|
14953|#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"It seems to seal the next target is the wind dark dragon army dragon country, and we have to get the Queen and Etna explain the matter." #M330090$Van Pelt$822$$1$0#|
14954|#&7$%n%##br#
 After you reach the head, was surprised to find standing there only one Bane. #M330090$Van Pelt$822$$1$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"Ah?! Bane, how only you? Agatha it?   #M330090$Van Pelt$822$$1$0#

#&7$Bain##br#
 Bane shook his head:
"... Agatha pending in that support, no way back." #M310090$Bain$1$$0$0#

#&7$Bain##br#
"Dark Dragon army has invaded the Star career corner and chant wind is clan war.
 The situation is very critical, need support.   #M310090$Bain$1$$0$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
 Head listened and nodded:
"OK, I see."#br# #M330090$Van Pelt$1$$1$0#|
14960|You say that the country's territorial wind dragon from Bane - Star Ya Long dark corner are suffering from military attacks, the decision Xianghuo Dragon and Water Dragon King for assistance.|
14961|#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"Well, Bane rest here before you, you go with me and the Queen Etna report the matter." #M330090$Van Pelt$822$$1$0#|
14962|#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"Go and ready to prepare it." #M330090$Van Pelt$822$$1$0#|
14963|#&7$%n%##br#
 You will be ready to go after the head of the report, found that you're the last to arrive.
 Everyone in attendance saw the head after he nodded and spoke and said:
"Ah, you worked hard."#char$$821$$0$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"As we have just learned, like Agatha responsible mining by the Bane and wind dragon country, are now being dark dragon army
 Attacks in urgent need of our help.   #M330090$Van Pelt$822$$1$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"However, this action can be said to be very dangerous... Of course, I do not not believe the eagle eye of our ability,
 However, everything should leave insurance. "
 Thus said the head deliberately stalled, the eagle looked at the reaction of the members of the eye. #M330090$Van Pelt$822$$1$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
 Head to see the owner kept the usual focus on listening, then continue opening:
"Therefore this action, by me, Bane, and departure responsible for carrying out like the others stay Calatrava fortress stand
 For backup support to prepare for contingencies.   #M330090$Van Pelt$822$$1$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"Above! Is there any problem?" #M330090$Van Pelt$822$$1$0#

#&7$Full##br#
"No!"#char$$821$$0$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"Good! Then, Bane, ready and then come after me, others disbanded place!" #M330090$Van Pelt$822$$1$0#|
14964|#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"Your Highness, we have important things that you would like to report."
 Van Pelt said the Etna line ceremony.
 Then you hear from Bane put there to report the matter to the round Etna. #M330090$Van Pelt$822$$1$0#

#&7$Esh-Baal##br#
"This is it... the wind dragon country hateful, dark dragon army group that really does not give us breathing free, obviously from the last war
 It did not take long time... they actually can recover so fast! "
 Etna said, unconsciously clenched his fists. #M360010$Esh-Baal$4$$1$0#

#&7$Sachiel##br#
"In my opinion, they are taking advantage of the occasion Lin Cang Blade disturb the stolen breath, perhaps in our fight against distraction Lin Cang blade when,
 They already revamp, sent troops to the wind dragon country.   #&7$Sachiel##br#

#&7$Sachiel##br#
"But now is not too late to send troops, we should proceed immediately, as soon as possible to prevent dark dragon army found the seal of the Dragon King of the wind." #&7$Sachiel##br#

 Etna listened, actually reflex distinguished from the face, and his face suddenly became very solemn. #M360010$Esh-Baal$4$$1$0#

#&7$Esh-Baal##br#
"Can not. It's too dangerous."
 Etna said coldly. #M360010$Esh-Baal$4$$1$0#

#&7$Esh-Baal##br#
"On the battlefield you can not imagine so easy, even the royal family, and must be at the forefront of all the soldiers closely aligned,

It's no surprise, then, that a candlemaker has asked the Hunters' League to retrieve some Wingrus Blubber. I'd like to assign you this task, but beware! There may be Hermit Crabs feasting on their carcasses.|
20021|This task was commissioned by Bailey, a candlemaker from Crescent Bay. Your goal is to extract some #&46$blubber# from the dead Wingruses on the beach. It doesn't sound like an overly dangerous task. Just watch out for Hermit Crabs—they won't be too happy about you interrupting their dinner!

20551|The Arashi Ireclaws in Echo Valley grow #&46$tough talons# that are useful as a high-quality building material. Naturally, Ireclaws don't take kindly to their talons being removed, and their aggression makes this assignment particularly challenging.

20552|This assignment requires you to collect Arashi Ireclaw talons in Echo Valley. Ireclaws are naturally vicious creatures, and you are advised to proceed with the utmost caution!#br#

20560|There is a beautiful Stonemaiden Flower that grows on the cliffs of Echo Valley, but because the area is also frequented by Grizzlejaws, the flowers are very difficult to collect and—not surprisingly—have become an accessory of great value.

Florist Munda is currently preparing his own flower show, and for this he wants a bouquet of Stonemaiden Flowers to impress his guests. He's come to the Hunters' League for help in gathering some of these rare flowers.|
20561|The #&46$Stonemaiden Flowers# that grow in Echo Valley are exquisitely beautiful, and their delicate fragrance has been described as nothing short of divine! They just so happen to grow, however, in an area home to Grizzlejaws, which makes the task of picking them rather dangerous. Watch your back on this assignment!

20590|Echo Valley is rich in natural resources, and the residents there know how to harvest them for their own use. These days, however, the villagers need a security escort when they're out working the mines and fields, mainly due to hostile Dragomon and treacherous terrain.

Garrison Officer Tevye is responsible for organizing the patrols, and when he's low on officers, he's been known to ask the Hunters' League for extra manpower.|
20591|This patrol assignment covers all of the Echo Valley villagers while they're at work with the aim of ensuring their safety at all times. It sounds easy enough, but keep a watchful eye out for any sudden Dragomon attacks.

20600|The Scarlet Fangsaurs in Echo Valley are known to harass the villagers, but they've been kept at bay with a campfire because they're afraid of smoke. More recently, we've been hearing that these Fangsaurs are going after the villagers who work to keep the campfire alight.

As a last resort, Garrison Officer Tevye has asked the Hunters' League to provide some assistance in solving this problem.|
20601|This assignment involves lighting the #&46$campfire# in Echo Valley to scare away the Scarlet Fangsaurs. Do be careful though, as they might attack you out of sheer rage!
 
  #M335010$Joanna$4$$1$0#|

20620|Flu season is upon us once again, and researchers have discovered that the Scarlet Fangsaurs in Echo Valley carry a mutated virus that causes their fur to quickly decay.

Tanner Rickson has developed a vaccine, and he wants you to test it on the highly contagious Great Scarlet Fangsaurs.|
20621|#&7$Rickson##br#
"Flu season is upon us again! Normally, the Security Council handles the majority#br#

#&7$Rickson##br#
"This infectious little virus accelerates the aging process in animal fur,#br#
 but so FAR, it seems it hasn't crossed over to humans... YET! Because#br#
 it's non-threatening to humans, though, the Security Council, in all its#br#

#&7$Rickson##br#
"I can tell you now, however, that if this virus is allowed to spread, it will spell#br#

20640|Echo Mine is home to Ironfang Jackals, a type of pack animal known for its brutal nature. They pose a constant threat to the mine workers.

Garrison Officer Philipette has asked the Hunters' League to send some professionals on regular hunting runs to bring these Dragomon under control.|
20641|This is a hunting assignment located in Echo Mine. Your objective is to rid the place of #&46$Ironfang Jackals#, which are compromising the security of the local mine workers.
 
  #M335010$Joanna$821$$1$0#|
20642|The Ironfang Jackals never had large enough numbers in Echo Mine to pose any real threat, but for some reason, they've started reproducing like bunnies! Before we even realized what was going on, there were so many of them that we now have no choice but to cull them.#br#

20650|Something curious is happening in Echo Mine—herds of Psychosaurs are stealing supplies from villages and running away before anyone can stop them!

Supply Officer Nizbel has contracted the Hunters' League for a search mission and has instructed us to dispatch a hunter to bring these stolen resources back as quickly as possible.|
20651|It's very rare for Dragomon to band together and steal things, but the Psychosaurs in Echo Mine are proof that it can happen. The objective of this assignment is to drive them away and retrieve the #&46$stolen supplies#.
 
  #M335010$Joanna$826$$1$0#|

20660|A mystical crystal tree that grows in Echo Mine is a regular source of Crystalite. This mineral can be ground into a powder that's used in a variety of industrial processes, but it's also the favorite food of the Giantclaw Pangolin.

Mine Foreman Dyciduous oversees the extraction of Crystalite, and he reports that his mine workers have recently faced an increasing number of attacks from Giantclaw Pangolins. The Foreman feels he has no choice but to ask the Hunters' League for help to keep production levels constant.|
20661|The crystal trees in Echo Mine produce #&46$Crystalite#, which is extremely useful as an industrial raw material. At first, I thought it was all some kind of joke, but this underground tree really does exist, so if you want to earn some extra cash, you should go and check it out.

20663|Pangolins' teeth are so hard, they're able to even bite through the toughest rock. In other words, if they get to a mineral before you do, they'll render it useless.  
 
  #M335010$Joanna$823$$1$0#|
20690|Once the Echo Mine workers have gathered a certain amount of Crystalite, they will send it back to the village. Sometimes, however, they're attacked by Ironfang Jackals on their way, and this disrupts the whole chain of logistics.

Spadesmith Hazel has put in a long-term delivery request for the Hunters' League requiring us to send someone to deliver the Crystalite despite the possibility of attacks from Ironfang Jackals.|
20691|The Echo Mine villagers put in a #&46$delivery request# for Crystalite. They want it delivered safely back to their village, but you'll have to be especially mindful of Ironfang Jackals ambushing you along the way.
 
  #M335010$Joanna$4$$1$0#|

20700|The Ironfang Jackals in Echo Mine often steal food, so the villagers are building a campfire to scare them off with smoke and fire. The clever jackals, however, have started to attack the villagers responsible for lighting the fire.

Garrison Officer Philipette recently tasked the Hunters' League with helping her keep the villagers safe.|
20701|This assignment involves lighting the #&46$campfire# in Echo Mine in order to scare away any Ironfang Jackals. You'll be fine so long as you keep an eye out for their sneaky ambushes!
 
  #M335010$Joanna$4$$1$0#|
20702|The Ironfang Jackals in Echo Mine are afraid of fire, but it's too much trouble to keep the campfire lit at all times. Instead, it can only be lit when the villagers are not at work.#br#

20722|#&7$Calixia##br#
"Remember, you have to inject the smallest ones in order for the vaccine to#br#

20760|The Forest Chameleoids in the Wraithwood are capable of changing color. They can camouflage themselves to look like a part of the forest, which enables them to attack unsuspecting travelers and villagers.

Garrison Officer Lorna Dune has requested that the Hunters' League send specialized trackers to come on regular hunting trips and reduce the number of Chameleoids in the area.|
20761|The #&46$Forest Chameleoid# changes color to blend in seamlessly with its surroundings. This form of camouflage allows it to attack people before they even know it's there, so if you're good at tracking animals, this assignment is for you.

20770|The Wraithwood is a harsh environment, and the only animal living there that humans can eat is the Crocamamie Pterosaur. The Pterosaur, however, is a naturally vicious animal that ordinary people should never attempt to catch.

Nonetheless, faced with soaring food import costs, a villager named Monika has asked the Hunters' League to send someone out to obtain Crocamamie Pterosaur meat for the villagers to eat.|
20771|#&46$Crocamamie Pterosaur meat# is the only meat available in Wraithwood. It is ALSO the objective of this assignment. When hunting this creature, take great care to avoid its sharp beak.
 
  #M335010$Joanna$821$$1$0#|
20772|I've tried this meat before... It doesn't taste all that good, but I guess bad meat is better than NO meat! Still, I feel pretty bad for the people of the Wraithwood. Their diet must really bite!#br#

20780|White Feldspars are a specialty of the Wraithwood. These beautiful, flawless oval stones are used in sculptures and ornaments. There's only one problem—Pebblepins often mistake the stones for their eggs and become very protective of them, making them difficult to collect.

Gemologist Chalcedony is now purchasing large quantities of White Feldspar, and he has asked the Hunters' League to send some personnel to drive away the turtles and collect the stones.|
20781|The White Feldspars in the #&46$Wraithwood# are opaque, flawlessly-smooth, perfectly oval stones. The problem is that the Pebblepins around there mistake them for their own eggs! Needless to say, it makes collecting them... "challenging." If you think you're up to it, though, try to clear them out!
 
  #M335010$Joanna$821$$1$0#|

21120|Not only is the weather at Everfrost Berg severe, supplies are also limited. To make matters worse, Boreasaurs are prowling around and looting the food reserves. This has led to serious injuries and fatalities amongst nearby villagers and travelers.

Garrison Officer Ogswald has sent in a permanent request for the Hunters' League in the hopes that safety can be restored for the locals.|
21121|This assignment is quite simple! Before the next delivery of supplies arrives in Everfrost Berg, a pack of thieving #&46$Boreasaurs# must be driven away!

21130|The Dracopards that live in Everfrost Berg boast rich, thick hides. Such pelts can be used to make soft, luxurious clothing that nobles throughout the region love to wear.

Tanner Rickson, in the capital, has asked for strong hunters to help collect Dracopard fur.|
21131|An assignment for #&46$Dracopard fur#! Dracopards are quite shy, and they are easily angered when provoked. As a result, the current market supply comes mainly from Hunters' League assignments.

Rose Vendor Tublooms has asked for a hunter's assistance in collecting these beautiful blossoms.|
21271|It's hard to believe such a beautiful flower could grow somewhere so utterly freezing, isn't it? And if the cold wasn't enough, it also happens to be the territory of the Sharkicanes.

21900|The poor ol' Rhinoroos have been pushed out of their habitat, so now they're constantly running in and out of the village, distressing the villagers.

You decide to help them out by setting up fences to stop the Rhinoroos from invading.|
21901|This is an assignment from the villagers 
to help them set-up the fences. 
It seems like an easy task, 
but those homeless Rhinoroo will make things more difficult, 
so be careful! #M602010$Ellen$821$$1$0#|
21902|The villagers will provide the materials you need to set up the fences. 
You just need to head on over there as quickly as you can! 
Just don't let those Rhinoroos get the best of you on the way! #M602010$Ellen$821$$1$0#|
21903|Well, I'll be! Looks like you did quite a job with those fences! 
Seems like you've become a bit of a celebrity in the village! 
I guess you'll want to be rewarded now. Well, here you go! And thank you.  #M602010$Ellen$821$$1$0#|

21930|The Rhinoroos has become very territorial after being pushed out of their previous habitat, so ecologists have developed a special tranquilizer in case they get too riled up.

You accept the assignment from the ecologists. Go and whisper sweet nothings to the Rhinoroos. I mean, go and tranquilize them to calm them down.|
21931|The wandering Rhinoroos have been scaring the residents, 
so they've been thinking about killing them. 
Ecologists, however, were appalled at this notion, and have developed a tranquilizer to calm them down. 
They just need someone to administer the dosage... #M602010$Ellen$821$$1$0#|

You don't want to fall victim to an enraged Rhinoroo. #M602010$Ellen$821$$1$0#|

You accept the assignment from the the Volcazar Restaurant to collect Toucandor eggs.|
21951|Legend speaks of a restaurant that sells empty plates in the Volcazar. 
Well, what I mean is that the Toucandor egg-cake is the Volcazar Restaurant's signature dish. 
The Toucandor egg-cakes are always sold out though, which is why it looks like they're just selling empty plates! 
As a result, the restaurant is always purchasing #&46$Toucandor Eggs#. Are you interested in this assignment? #M602010$Ellen$821$$1$0#|
21952|Don't forget that, aside from watching out for the Toucandors,

To prove yourself, go and battle Rhinoroos in the Broilt Charlands!|
21961|A letter's arrived for you, but it's not just a typical letter. 
It's a challenge letter from a drakeling called Lyurm, 
and he wants you to prove yourself by hunting a few #&46$Rhinoroos#. 
Are you willing to accept Lyurm's challenge? #M602010$Ellen$821$$1$0#|
21962|Although this is an excellent opportunity to dazzle them with your abilities, 
remember not to force yourself! You know what they say—if you're not safe, you're dead. #M602010$Ellen$821$$1$0#|
21963|Amazing! Even the mighty Rhinoroo is not match for you. 
I would guess that Lyurm is impressed by those moves. 
Here, take this reward and relax. You've earned it. #M602010$Ellen$821$$1$0#|
21970|You've received a second challenge letter! Lyurm seems unfazed by your previous challenge and says that you can only prove yourself by defeating some Vambats.

You accept Lyurm's challenge again. Go and battle Vambats on Stygian Peak!|
21971|Well, lookie here! It's another letter for you! Looks like someone's got an admirer... 
Oh, nevermind. It seems to be another challenge letter from Lyurm. 
It says that only those who can beat a few #&46$Vambats# 
can rival him. So? Are you up to the challenge? #M602010$Ellen$821$$1$0#|
21972|I can sense your excitement for the challenge ahead! 
Just know your own strength and don't overexert yourself! #M602010$Ellen$821$$1$0#|
21973|You've completed the challenge, but you've come out a much different hunter than 
before— an even stronger hunter! Now go and get some rest. You'll be needing it 
now that you've proved yourself a worthy hunter. Here's your reward.

to help gather up all that nasty refuse. 
Manage to clean things up, and he's sure to reward you handsomely!|
22302|To reach Muckmoor Downs simply follow the bridge 
until you catch sight of the garbage! You can't miss it! 
You'd best use caution when gathering it up, though—who knows what sorts of nasty surprises have drifted in on the tide!|
22303|The marshlands by the bridge look better than ever, now, and don't appear to have  suffered any lasting effects from the garbage! 
Here's a reward for a job well done!  You've certainly earned it!|
22310|Laid up with an injured foot, Craftsman Wallace is unable to deliver his customers' orders.

Help him out by bringing the finished products to Evan and Elisa.|
22311|This assignment comes from Craftsman Wallace. 
Yet another workshop accident has put his foot momentarily out of commission, 
leaving him in need of someone to deliver armor and weapons commissioned by two of his best customers. 
The job doesn't require battling any Dragomon, but he's still sure to reward you generously for your help!|
22312|Be careful not to drop any of the orders!  Damaged products mean unhappy customers!|
22313|Wallace sends his thanks for helping him out of a jam! 
Here's a reward for a job well done!  You've certainly earned it!|
22314|"I see Wallace has recruited someone to make his deliveries for him! I'll be you#br#

22315|For the life of me, I'll never understand how a craftsman with such talented hands#br#
could own such clumsy feet! Haha!"|
22320|The salty mist blown in from the sea has finally taken its toll on the outer walls of Antebellum's house.

Help him out by fetching some Whistwater Lurker hide to patch up the holes.|
22321|This assignment comes from Bank Teller Antebellum. 
Years of sea spray exposure have eroded the walls, which now resemble Swiss cheese more than they do a house. 
Fed up with living in a such a pitted palace, Antebellum is seeking a hunter who 
can supply him with the Whistwater Lurker hide he needs to patch things up.  Hunting the beast won't be easy, but your efforts are sure to merit a sizable reward!|
22322|Whistwater Lurkers are known to live near the sea.  Follow the bridge, and you should spot them easily enough. 
These creatures are far from docile, so be sure to keep your guard up when engaging them!|
22323|Congratulations on completing the quest!  Whether skinning Whistwater Lurkers or patching drafty holes, you certainly show 'em who's boss! 
Here's a reward for a job well done!  You've certainly earned it!|
22330|A recent Hardrock Aerodillo invasion has made travel into the village increasingly dangerous, resulting in far fewer visits by the Trade Delegation and a substantial blow to the local economy.

Help Lyrie restore trade to the area by reducing the beasts' numbers!|
22331|The Trade Delegation's visits to the village have all but stopped, and now he knows why. 
An influx of Hardrock Aerodillos in the area is threatening the safety of those attempting to make their way to the village. 
Some visiting merchants have even resorted to hiring Cavaliers to ensure their safe passage. 
Desperate to resolve the issue, Lyrie is seeking a hunter to significantly reduce the 
Hardrock Aerodillo population. |
22332|The majority of them are occupying the area surrounding the Northern Sea Bridge.  Be sure to keep your eyes peeled once you get there! |
22333|Their natural ability to camouflage amongst the rocks can make them tricky to spot! 
Thanks to your hard work, the road into the village is once  again safe to travel! 
Here's a reward for a job well done!  You've certainly earned it!|
22340|With his hands full carrying out orders from Van Pelt, Omi is looking for someone who can meet with Manuel in his stead.

Help him by taking care of business with the grocer.|
22341|This assignment comes from Falcon Pilot Omi. 
Unable to leave his post due to orders from Van Pelt, Omi is seeking someone dependable 
to carry out an important transaction for him. 
Though a bit on the mysterious side, the task is a simple one—deliver Omi's items 
to Manuel and bring back whatever you're given in exchange! |
22342|It may not involve hunting Dragomon, but this task isn't any  less important! 
Put your best foot forward!|
22343|Good work completing Omi's request! 
Here's a reward for a job well done!  You've certainly earned it!|
22344|Finally! It's HERE! She's going to LOVE it! Thanks for all your help, %n%!#br#
The cost of feeding an Aeromon is enough to bankrupt anyone, but she's worth it! #br#|

 Fire helps us do everything from cook food to heat our homes. We'd scarcely survive without it."

"Firewood is in short supply these days, so we've taken to supplementing our fuel with wax."

#&7$Lyrie##br#
"That said, our only option is to brave the Whistwater Lurkers' nests and hope for#br#

22390|There are too many dangerous Dragomon in Salt Crystal Marsh for Noam to mine the special ore he needs to forge stronger weapons.

Help him out by retrieving some!|
22391|By way of a fortunate accident, Noam discovered a mineral ore that's not only stronger than standard metal but also easier to forge. 
It could revolutionize weapons and armor as we know them! 
Unfortunately, the only known source of the ore is located in the hazardous Salt Crystal Marsh. 
Noam is seeking a brave hunter who can enter the area, mine the ore, and make it back in one piece! 
Of course, greater risk means greater pay! |
22392|And this job is certainly not without risk! 
Salt Crystal Marsh is teeming with Dragomon, none of which would hesitate to rip you apart without a second thought! |
22393|Excellent! Noam couldn't stop remarking on how quickly you managed to complete the job! 
Here's a reward for a job well done!  You've certainly earned it!|
22400|The sheer size of Scythopods has prevented Armor Merchant Lambent from getting her hands on their shells for her research into enhanced armor development.

Collect some and bring them back to her!|
22401|Lambent is convinced the secret to the Scythopod's resilience lies in its impenetrable exoskeleton. 
In order to put her theories to the test, she needs to study their shells. 
Unfortunately, the size of these Dragomon alone is enough to make to them incredibly dangerous.  Lambent is reluctant to put any life at risk, even for the sake of research. 
That said, her instructions are very clear—you 
are to collect shells ONLY from the carcasses.|
22402|While dead Scythopods may sound harmless enough, there are still plenty of live ones 
in the area to keep you on your toes!  Make sure to stay on your guard while collecting the shells! |
22403|Congratulations on completing the job!  With these shells, Lambent is one step closer to developing the perfect armor! 
Here's a reward for a job well done!  You've certainly earned it!|
22410|Angie's latest potion calls for tsaoko fruit, but alas she's fresh out! As its name implies, this special fruit grows only deep within the ruins, making it troublesome to harvest.

Traverse the ruins and gather some of the fruit to help her out!|
22411|This assignment comes from Grocer Angie. 
To meet the upsurge in demand for potions along the Northern Sea Bridge, 
Angie needs much more of the primary ingredient. 
Unfortunately, tsaoko fruit doesn't grow just anywhere. 
She's seeking a strong hunter capable not only of navigating the ruins and harvesting the fruit, |
22412|but also surviving an encounter with the notoriously ferocious resident Dragomon.  Be sure to keep your wits about you! |
22413|You went through all that trouble over fruit?  I'm told they can't be eaten raw,  but I might just sneak a nibble to see what all the fuss is about! 
Just don't tell Angie!  Here's a reward for a job well done!  You've certainly earned it!|
22420|To better keep tabs on the amount of potable water available, those in the Merchant's Hideaway closely monitor the quality of the local water source.

Lend the mayor a hand by recording the quality of the water outside the village.|
22421|Though the Merchant's Hideaway is located near a large body of water, its naturally salty composition means not all of it is usable. 
Keeping track of how much of it is, however, could help prevent a water crisis. 
This assignment comes from Mayor Lyrie. 
Due to recurrent short-staffing, he needs someone to visit the area outside the village and conduct a routine analysis of the water there. |
22422|This in itself might not be all that dangerous, but doing so with a number of 
vicious Dragomon nearby certainly will be!  No wonder the village is short-staffed when it comes to jobs like these!  You'd best keep your guard up! |
22423|I can't say I understand what any of these numbers mean,  but the mayor will surely put them to good use! 
Here's a reward for a job well done!  You've certainly earned it!|
22424|Use the Water Quality Calculator by a water source|
22430|A recent swarm of Scythopods has been causing an upset near the village entrance. Desperate to rid themselves of these terrifying creatures, the villagers have pooled their funds to hire a skilled hunter.

Put their fears to rest by taking care of their bug problem!|
22431|Dangerous Scythopods have been spotted roaming the area near the village entrance. 
One look at them is enough to give anyone nightmares! 
Until the problem is dealt with, it doesn't look like anyone will be coming in or out of the village! 
Can you exterminate them and restore everyone's peace of mind? |
22432|The Scythopods' razor-sharp forelegs aren't the only things you've got to look out for when engaging them. 
They can also move with incredible speed. 
You'll have to stay two steps ahead if you hope to defeat them all! |
22433|It goes without saying this particular assignment didn't attract a lot of volunteers, 
but you handled it like a boss!  The villagers can rest peacefully tonight! 
Here's a reward for a job well done!  You've certainly earned it!|
22440|The Dragomon have been increasingly unpredictable as of late and, as expected, the mayor is having a difficult time finding a person willing to look into the situation.

Help him by patrolling the ruins to get a better sense of the problem.|
22441|The mayor is concerned about a recent change in the moods of the local Dragomon.  They've been acting more aggressively with each passing day, and it's unclear how far things will escalate. 
As mayor, Lyrie has a whole list of other problems to deal with, including finding someone 
to scout the area within the ruins. 
The assignment calls for experienced hunters to keep an eye on the Dragomon should they attack the village. |
22442|The ruins are already treacherous to navigate. 
Coupled with the increasingly hostile Dragomon, this job will be far from easy!  Make sure to stay vigilant at all times while on patrol. |
22443|I'm relieved to see you made it back in one piece! 
I'll head off now and relay your observations to the mayor! 
Here's a reward for a job well done!  You've certainly earned it!|
22450|The Insectomon aren't the only creatures acting strangely—the Hardrock Aerodillos in the area have also turned abnormally aggressive. Worried for the safety of the villagers, Lyrie is desperately seeking hunters to eliminate the threat.

Help the mayor by eradicating them.|
22451|Some of the villagers have reported terrifying run-ins with the Hardrock Aerodillos inhabiting the area. 
Whereas normally they'd take refuge in the rocky surroundings when provoked, they're now attacking anyone they come across. 
This assignment comes from Mayor Lyrie. 
He's looking for experienced hunters to take out these unusually violent Hardrock Aerodillos. |
22452|Don't underestimate these creatures! They may be relatively docile by nature, but the ones menacing the villagers are far from normal! 
Their tough skins will also make them particularly difficult to defeat, so be prepared! |
22453|I had every confidence you'd be able to handle this job! 
The villagers can now move about the area without fear of being attacked. 
Excellent work, indeed!  Here's a reward for a job well done!  You've certainly earned it!|
22460|Unwilling to risk losing a hand (or more!), local merchants are seeking someone to deliver a shipment of artillery shells for them.

Lend them your services by carefully transporting the shells to the fort.|
22461|If there's a market for it, the traders at the Merchant Camp will stock it! 
However, when it comes to more volatile goods like big ammunition, they're understandably more than a little reluctant to handle them personally. 
That said, the merchants are looking to hire brave hunters willing to transport the artillery shells for them. |
22462|They may not have monstrous jaws or razor-sharp appendages, but these shells are no less dangerous than any Dragomon.  Make sure to handle them with the utmost care lest they explode! |
22463|This may be atypical work for a hunter, but your courage and quick reflexes are just 
what this particular assignment requires! 
Here's a reward for a job well done!  You've certainly earned it!|
22464|Deliver the artillery shells to the fort|

Go track down an innocent Quackadactyl in Viridian Forest and pound it to a pulp to obtain its tail feathers.  A-hunting you will go!|
50431|#&7$Karen##br#
"Hi there, %n%. Hey %p%.#br#
 What can I do for you today?" #M809010s100+30$Karen$822$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You shake your head to indicate that you're just passing by,#br#
 but Qyubey comes over to you.#char$$821$$0$0#

#&7$Karen##br#
"Oh, Qyubey!#br#
 There's still some time before our scheduled meeting,#br#
 what brings you here so soon?"#br#
 Karen asks with genuine surprise. #M809010s100+30$Karen$4$$1$0#

#&7$Qyubey##br#
"Sorry, Karen,#br#
 but I'm afraid things have changed a little.#br#
 I won't be able to finish in time unless I get these items quickly,"#br#
 Qyubey says, looking somewhat embarrassed. #M802010s100+30$Qyubey$4$$0$0#

#&7$Karen##br#
"Oh, what a shame...#br#
 I haven't really prepared anything yet.#br#
 Worse still, I'm busy with commissions and can't really spare anyone at the moment."#br#
 Karen flips through her notebook with a furrowed brow. #M809010s100+30$Karen$831$$1$0#

#&7$Qyubey##br#
"Please, Karen, you've got to help me.#br#
 This thing... well, you know what I mean!"#br#
 Qyubey stops short when she realizes she shouldn't have let that remark slip. #M802010s100+30$Qyubey$831$$0$0#

#&7$Qyubey##br#
"Listen, I'm not looking for trouble.#br#
 I'm really sorry to bother you, but I promise I'll make it worth your while!"#br#
 Qyubey is pleading with open palms at this point. #M802010s100+30$Qyubey$1$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Qyubey doesn't even seem to notice you,#br#
 so once she's done speaking#br#
 you and %p% go over to greet her.#br#
 Seeing you prompts her to glance around frantically.#char$$4$$1$0#

#&7$Qyubey##br#
"Oh! %n% and %p%... Uhm, hi.#br#
 What about Agatha... is she here, too?#br#
 Don't tell me she knows that I..."#br#
 Qyubey looks about nervously. #M802010s100+30$Qyubey$3$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Qyubey, you can relax now.#br#
 Agatha isn't here at the moment,#br#
 but if there's something you want to talk to her about, I can pass on a message,"#br#
 %p% says with a smile.#pets100+30$$4$$1$0#

#&7$Qyubey##br#
"Well, I... I haven't, um...#br#
 I have nothing to hide from Agatha! N-n-nothing at all!#br#
 I came here because... because..."#br#
 Qyubey mumbles something, her gaze fixed on the floor. #M802010s100+30$Qyubey$826$$0$0#

#&7$Karen##br#
"Hehe, it's not so bad, really. #br#
 Qyubey, if what you say is true,#br#
 why don't we ask %n% and %p% to help gather the materials?#br#
 With these two helping us out, you'll get it done in no time." #M809010s100+30$Karen$4$$1$0#

#&7$Qyubey##br#
"So %n% and %p% have become a reliable team?#br#
 It seems like only yesterday when we found %p% a partner...#br#
 anyway, will you lend me a hand?"#br#
 Qyubey's eyes are full of hope as she asks you for help. #M802010s100+30$Qyubey$4$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You can't resist Qyubey's pleading,#br#
 and ask Karen what materials to get.#char$$4$$1$0#

#&7$Karen##br#
"Oh, wonderful! This will be so much easier with your help.#br#
 Please gather some #&46$Quackadactyl Tail Feathers from Viridian Forest#,#br#
 I'll collect the rest soon enough.#br#
 I know it's inconvenient, but these things are really important to Qyubey." #M809010s100+30$Karen$831$$0$0#

#&7$Qyubey##br#
"Thank you, from the bottom of my heart.#br#
 I won't forget your kindness!"#br#
 Qyubey bows to each of you in turn. #M802010s100+30$Qyubey$822$$0$0#|
50432|#&7$Karen##br#
"Right. I'm pretty much done with gathering all the materials.#br#
 I sure hope Qyubey manages to meet her deadline,"#br#
 Karen says, checking off items from her list. #M809010s100+30$Karen$4$$1$0#|
50433|#&7$Karen##br#
"Qyubey, look!#br#
 %n% and %p% are back already!#br#
 D'ya think you can make it on time now?"#br#
 Karen asks, gleefully patting Qyubey on the back. #M809010s100+30$Karen$4$$1$0#

#&7$Qyubey##br#
"%n%, %p%—that was great work!#br#
 I suppose you have the Quackadactyl Tail Feathers?"#br#
 You hand her a bushel of feathers. #M802010s100+30$Qyubey$4$$0$0#

#&7$Qyubey##br#
"Wow! These are some quality feathers.#br#
 Karen said you were dependable, and by golly she was right!#br#
 I honestly couldn't have done it without your help."#br#
 After striking the feathers from her list, Qyubey takes a deep bow in a gesture of gratitude. #M802010s100+30$Qyubey$822$$0$0#

#&7$Karen##br#
"Mhm-hm... mhm... okay, everything is ready.#br#
 Qyubey, there's no time to lose!#br#
 Quickly, get back to the workshop and do your thing..."#br#
 Karen hands Qyubey a bundle of all the required materials. #M809010s100+30$Karen$4$$1$0#

#&7$Qyubey##br#
"Fantastic! I'll get straight to work.#br#
 Thank you all for your generous help!" #M802010s100+30$Qyubey$822$$0$0#

#&7$Qyubey##br#
"Hey, %n%, one more thing... please don't tell Agatha yet.#br#
 I'll do it myself when the time is right. Bye bye..."#br#
 Qyubey gathers up the remaining materials and scurries away. #M802010s100+30$Qyubey$831$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You and %p% are both curious about what exactly Qyubey is up to,#br#
 so you go ask Karen,#br#
 but all you get for an answer is an enigmatic smile.#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Karen##br#
"I'm afraid I can't tell you anything:#br#
 I promised Qyubey not to tell a living soul." #M809010s100+30$Karen$822$$1$0#

#&7$Karen##br#
...but seeing how you helped her out,#br#
 I'm sure she'll tell you all about it if you ask her nicely."#br#
 Karen seems apologetic in her response. #M809010s100+30$Karen$831$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 This whole affair has become pretty mysterious,#br#
 but for the time being, you have no choice but to contain your curiosity--#br#
 at least until Qyubey finishes whatever it is she's doing so that you can ask her about it.#char$$4$$0$0#|
50440|Michaela is following Marvin's advice and hopes to tame a wild Dragomon to  show off her gentler side. Perhaps that way she can impress Lelouch! Though you haven't seen much evidence of Michaela's having a gentler side, you've always wanted to catch a Pantherus.

Head to Viridian Forest and catch a Pantherus using a sturdy rope. |
50441|#&7$Michaela##br#
"Well, well, it's just as I feared.#br#
 I haven't managed to buy anything I need,#br#
 and this trip is turning into a real waste of time."#br#
 Michaela snorts as she sizes up the goods in Marvin's store. #M807010s100+30$Michaela$831$$1$0#

#&7$Marvin##br#
"I'm sorry, Miss.#br#
 Perhaps you could tell me what you're looking for,#br#
 and I'll add it to my inventory when I do the next order,"#br#
 Marvin says, forcing a fake smile across his lips. #M812010s100+30$Marvin$4$$0$0#

#&7$Michaela##br#
"Yes, well that's for you to decide!#br#
 It's your store after all... anyways, tell me#br#
 who d'you think is better, me or Karen?"#br#
 Michaela asks Marvin with feigned innocence. #M807010s100+30$Michaela$4$$1$0#

#&7$Marvin##br#
"That's a difficult question to answer,#br#
 but if I have to... I'd say you've been better.#br#
 I mean, at least you come here every once in a while; Karen hasn't even been once...#br#
 although to be fair, I haven't made a penny off either of you." #M812010s100+30$Marvin$831$$0$0#

#&7$Michaela##br#
"Right, sure! Of course you would say that,#br#
 but Lelouch is always talking and laughing with her, and they totally ignore me,#br#
 And I've thought about it over and over but I still don't know why..."#M807010s100+30$Michaela$1$$1$0#

#&7$Michaela##br#
"Oh, hey. %n% and %p% are here. The two of you are close to Karen, right?#br# Tell me what that oh-so-kind Karen has that I don't!"
   #M807010s100+30$Michaela$831$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Although you wouldn't exactly describe Karen as "kind,"#br#
 it goes without saying that she's nicer than Michaela.#br#
 You try to be as diplomatic as possible to keep from#br#
 setting off Michaela's temper.#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Michaela##br#
"Honestly, I've always felt that kindness is overrated...#br#
 but I won't allow Karen to get one over on me just because of that.#br#
 Marvin! MARVIN!!" She immediately spins around, her eyes burning#br# daggers into Marvin's skull. "I need something that will make me... kinder."
   #M807010s100+30$Michaela$831$$1$0#

#&7$Marvin##br#
"Miss, I'm sorry, but nothin' I got here can change your basic nature, see?#br#
 You could try takin' a few courses in Hoppalong conduct! You know, the one—"#br#
 Michaela interrupts him with a frustrated shriek. #M812010s100+30$Marvin$4$$0$0#

#&7$Michaela##br#
"Course? What course?! I need not this 'training' you speak of!#br#
 What do you take me for?! The nerve of some people!#br#
 There's nothing that interests me in this lousy shop. I think I'll go look elsewhere."#br#
 With that, Michaela turns to leave, but Marvin hurriedly calls after her. #M807010s100+30$Michaela$301$$1$0#

#&7$Marvin##br#
"Miss, wait! Please, don't go!#br#
 I... I just had a thought!" #M812010s100+30$Marvin$4$$0$0#

#&7$Marvin##br#
"Think about it—wild animals seem fierce, see?#br#
 but next to a fierce lion, even a Grizzlejaw will appear docile.#br#
 What I mean is..."#br#
 Marvin keeps it vague in an attempt to pique Michaela's interest. #M812010s100+30$Marvin$4$$0$0#

#&7$Michaela##br#
"So... what you're saying is, if I were to take a fierce wild Pantherus as a pet,#br#
 that would balance out my gentler side?#br#
 That's not a bad idea... why didn't you say that in the first place?"#br#
 At this point, Michaela is nodding her head in approval. #M807010s100+30$Michaela$831$$1$0#

#&7$Marvin##br#
"Er... right, yes, that's the idea, see?#br#
 Let me find a hunter for you... Just wait a quick minute..."#br#
 "Gentle side, haha. Even a Drakemon would look nice compared to THIS witch."#br#
 Marvin shakes his head with a gratuitous sigh. #M812010s100+30$Marvin$831$$0$0#

#&7$Michaela##br#
"Hah! 'Wait,' he says!" Michaela picks up a #&46$sturdy rope##br#  from the shop display. "%n%, I'll let you take care of it.#br# #&46$Catching a wild Pantherus# shouldn't be a challenge for you, hm?#br#
  
  
    #M807010s100+30$Michaela$831$$1$0#

#&7$Marvin##br#
"I, uh... yes! YES! That was my idea all along, see? And that's#br# MY rope, see?  Which still needs to be paid for, by the way."#br#
 Flustered, Marvin tries to snatch back his rope.  
   #M812010s100+30$Marvin$825$$0$0#

#&7$Michaela##br#
"Marvin, give it a rest.#br#
 You wouldn't recognize a business opportunity if it bit you in the face.#br#
 You'll never make more than chump change if you stay focused on petty profits."#br#
 Michaela has her hands on her hips and fixes Marvin with her most ice cold glare. #M807010s100+30$Michaela$831$$1$0#

#&7$Marvin##br#
"I-... yes! YES! Absolutely! I, uh, see what you mean... see?#br#
 My mistake, truly! I never thought of that before.#br# Quite, uh, shameful, really... yes." Marvin fumbles#br#
 for his notebook and starts scribbling.
   #M812010s100+30$Marvin$827$$0$0#

#&7$Michaela##br#
"I guess that's settled then.#br#
 %p%, take these combat-value detecting glasses with you,#br#

 from behind his notebook.

"Hey! That Pantherus looks... interesting. Untie the rope and let me have#br#

 of your Pantherus.

#&7$Michaela##br#
"%p%, one little Pantherus doesn't scare me in the least,#br#

 the poor creature."#br#

#&7$Michaela##br#
"Now that's more like it!#br#
 From now on, you'll be my pet...#br#
 and not just any creature gets that honor. You should be proud of yourself!"#br#
 Michaela slowly approaches the drowsy Pantherus. #M807010s100+30$Michaela$4$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"According to Marvin's combat-value detector,#br#

 as high as a million!"#br#
 %p% activates the detector glasses he's been wearing.#pets100+30$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Pantherus##br#
 The Pantherus becomes aware that Michaela is approaching,#br#
 and suddenly assumes an aggressive stance#br#
 and lets out a fearsome roar...#br#
 Annoyed, Michaela stops short in her tracks. #M029010s60+10$Pantherus$601$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Huh. This Pantherus' combat value is even higher than back in Viridian Forest:#br#
 one point one million... one point two million...#br#
 incredible, it's still rising!"#br#
 %p% is taken aback and stares in disbelief at the figure on the glasses.#pets100+30$$1$$1$0#

#&7$Pantherus##br#
"Rwwwooaarrrrr!!!"#br#
 Visibly agitated, the Pantherus belts out another huge roar#br#
 and pounces at Michaela. #M029010s60-10$Pantherus$2031$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Three million!! It's up to three million!#br#
 Michaela, that figure is off the charts, you'd better watch out!"#br#
 %p% shouts anxiously.#pets100+30$$831$$1$0#

#&7$Michaela##br#
"So RUDE!"#br#
 Michaela stamps the ground defiantly, her hands firmly on her hips. #M807010s100+30$Michaela$101$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Arghhh!! My eyes! There's something wrong with the detector—it's#br# hurting my eyes!" There's a brief, cracking sound, and then the glasses#br#
 glasses on %p%'s face abruptly shatter!
 #pets100+30$$827$$0$0#

#&7$Pantherus##br#
 All of a sudden, the fierce Pantherus inexplicably becomes docile.#br#
 It lies down gently on its stomach in front of Michaela#br#
 and gives off a timid whimper. #M029010s60-10$Pantherus$207$$0$0#

#&7$Michaela##br#
"I say, that's more like it.#br#
 Your life will be much better if you behave."#br#
 Michaela crouches down and scratches the Pantherus behind the ears, much to the beast's delight. #M807010s100+30$Michaela$831$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You help %p% clear away the shattered glass, which miraculously hasn't injured his eyes.#br#
 As you reflect on the events that just unfolded before you,#br#
 your guess is that Michaela has increased her combat value#br#

50460|Michaela is heartbroken because Lelouch disapproves of her Dragomon pet. She's looking for a scapebunny, and Marvin seems to fit the bill since the pet Pantherus was his idea. With Michaela dissolved in tears, and threatening him with one of her trademark beatings, Marvin feels a tinge of guilt. Marvin's always so thoughtful when someone's about to punch him!

He begs you go to the hot springs in Echo Valley and bring back some spring water for Michaela.  What are you waiting for? Let's vamoose!|

 As you pass by Marvin's stall, you hear shouting and screaming:#br#
 "Don't run away, you little cheat!"—"It wasn't me!"#br#
 you hurry over to see what all the fuss is about. #M812010s100+30$Marvin$823$$1$0#

#&7$Michaela##br#
"How dare you try to swindle me! Hold it right there, you thieving fiend!"#br#
 Michaela picks up the closest thing from Marvin's stall#br#
 and chases after him like she's going to smash it over his head. #M807010s100+30$Michaela$825$$0$0#

#&7$Marvin##br#
"I didn't do anything!! How was I supposed to know things would turn out this way?!#br#

#&7$Michaela##br#
"%p%, step aside at once!#br#

#&7$Michaela##br#
"Oh, uhm... well..."#br#
 Michaela finally manages to calm down a little.#br#
"It's all because Marvin tried to dupe me..."#br#
 Marvin trembles as Michaela shoots him a ferocious glance. #M807010s100+30$Michaela$827$$0$0#

#&7$Marvin##br#
"B-but... I had no idea you'd take the Pantherus with you everywhere you go!#br#
 Of course that means other people won't dare to come near you, see?!"#br#
 Marvin is still shaking,#br#
 and it takes everything he's got to speak out against her. #M812010s100+30$Marvin$3$$1$0#

#&7$Michaela##br#
"What do I care about other people!#br#
 They're all so rude...But oh, Lelouch..."#br#
 Michaela's demeanor softens visibly as she speaks Lelouch's name. #M807010s100+30$Michaela$827$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You're relieved that she seems to have given up on Marvin,#br#
 but now Michaela is just hanging around like a wet towel without saying a word...#br#
 Your only option is to ask Marvin what happened.#char$$826$$0$0#

#&7$Marvin##br#
"Once Michaela brought the Pantherus home,#br#
 she took it everywhere she went... imagine that, a fearsome Dragomon!#br#
 People were terrified, of course."#br#
 With Michaela now more docile, Marvin stands up and shakes off the dust. #M812010s100+30$Marvin$2$$1$0#

#&7$Michaela##br#
"But, but... when I ask people if they think I'm a gentler person now,"#br#
 they all agree whole-heartedly. They even go out of their way to compliment my new pet!"#br#
 It's obvious that Michaela sees things differently than Marvin. #M807010s100+30$Michaela$831$$0$0#

#&7$Marvin##br#
"They were agreeing because they value their lives...!#br#

"Lelouch...#br#

 and moist with tears. #M807010s100+30$Michaela$827$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Who'd have thought that Michaela, the most arrogant Hoppalong you've met,#br#
 would ever have a breakdown in front of you like this.#br#
 It seems that Lelouch's scolding has put Michaela into a deep depression.#br#
 You're not really sure what to do. You've never seen her look this helpless.#char$$826$$1$0#

"Oh... right. Okay, alright! Don't feel bad--it's all my fault!#br#
 As a way of apologizing, I'll give you some information for free!"#br#

 Marvin's conscience once again makes a rare appearance. #M812010s100+30$Marvin$822$$1$0#

#&7$Michaela##br#

"Rumor has it, the #&46$hot springs in Echo Valley# have therapeutic properties.#br#

"You are one greedy creature! You cannot take back that which has been lost...#br#
 I shall punish your insolence by taking away that which you love most; money! #br#
 You shall be a poor wretch for one week!"#br#
 The Elf emits a dazzling light, and when it dies both the Elf and the golden Fate are gone. #M043020$Lake Elf$1$$1$0#

"Where... where am I...?"#br#
 Fate stretches sleepily. #M808010s100+30$Fate$2$$1$0#

"Do you have any idea what we've been through trying to find you?!#br#
 What on Earth even happened to you?" #M805010s100+30$Mholt$831$$0$0#

"I... I was gathering some, er, test samples by the lake...#br#
 I slipped and fell into the water...#br#

#&7$Mysterious Orb##br#
 As the light fades, the orb finally finishes taking shape,#br#
 until it's only half the height of a normal person, and has long bunny ears. #M810010s100+30$Mysterious Orb$1$$1$0#

#&7$Lake Elf##br#
"I am the Elf who dwells in the lake..."#br#
 Did you lose something here?"#br#
 The smaller size doesn't mean the Elf's voice is any quieter,#br#
 and even though it has turned into a Hoppalong, it still speaks in the same solemn tone of voice. #M810010s100+30$Lake Elf$1$$1$0#

 Interestingly, the orb near Silus#br#
 looks exactly like Eren,#br#

"...this is boring, I don't want to play any more!"#br#
 The Elf suddenly emits a flash of light, then swells up and bursts,#br#

 You're hesitant to accept,#br#

#&7$%p%##br#
"To the lucky person who opens this chest,#br#
      the real treasure is the anticipation and excitement you felt during the hunt itself.#br#
   Although it might seem a little underwhelming, the memories you made are priceless."#br#
 After reading this, %p% bends down and thinks.#pets100+30$$1$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"So what this means... is that the person who drew that map#br#
 was hoping that whoever found the chest wouldn't care about what was inside it, #br#
 but instead about the experience itself? Oh... that's a really inspiring thought."#br#
 %p%says, all of a sudden.#pets100+30$$831$$0$0#

#&7$Marvin##br#
"I don't need... any useless inspiration...#br#
 My money... I want my stinking money! Argh!"#br#

#&7$Marvin##br#
"What kind of joker set up this scam...?#br#
 They'll pay for this!#br#
 Marvin collapses to the floor and starts sobbing. #M812010s100+30$Marvin$826$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Marvin spent quite a bit of money on the treasure map, but it looks like it was all for nothing.#br#
 Maybe this is why Marvin is always broke.#br#
 You and %p% try to calm him down, but he's just too devastated to listen.#br#
 The best thing to do is to let Marvin sit in silence. There's nothing you can do for him right now.#char$$1$$0$0#|

If you can do that, I know just the thing!#br#
 I've wanted to try using #&46$Jackal Forelegs# in a dish since forever.#br# 
 %n%, I'll leave it to you.#br#
 I'd really like to filet this feathered fowl, but I can control myself just this once." #M803010s100+30$Omi$831$$1$0#

 Mr. Supernatural squawks, cries and offers his thanks all at the same time.#br#

"Smarter than your average Ireclaw?#br#
 Compared to this nattering nincompoop,#br#
 an Ireclaw that can't speak sounds a lot smarter to me.",#br#
 says Omi, glaring in Mr. Supernatural's direction. #M803010s100+30$Omi$1$$1$0#|
50523|#&7$Omi##br#
"Whoa! %n%, %p%, thanks a lot, you guys.#br#
 These Jackal Forelegs are of amazing quality.#br#
 I'll put these ingredients to good use."#br#
 Omi happily accepts the foreleg meat, thanking you as he does so. #M803010s100+30$Omi$822$$1$0#

#&7$Mr. Supernatural##br#
"Squawk! Okay then, can you let me go? Squawk.#br# I need to go, squawk, find my pants#br# and continue, squawk, my journey."#br#
 Mr. Supernatural pleads.

#&7$Omi##br#
"Yes, please leave.#br#
 I like to listen to good music while I cook, see.#br#
 I can't focus with you squawking about."#br#
 Omi shoos Mr. Supernatural away and then starts cooking. #M803010s100+30$Omi$4$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Mr. Supernatural, we just picked these up off the ground...#br#
 They're brown and have holes in them. Although they're different from the red trousers you #br# were talking about, maybe they'll help you somehow?"#br#
  
 %p% shows the tattered clothes to Mr. Supernatural.#pets100+30$$4$$1$0#

#&7$Mr. Supernatural##br#
"Squawk, squawk, squawk! Yes, that's them!#br# My babies, squawk, the red trousers!#br#
 Quickly! Give them back to me, squawk!"#br#
 Mr. Supernatural squawks with joy as he snatches the trousers from %p%.

#&7$Mr. Supernatural##br#
"Squawk haha, my strength has returned. Squawk. That damned Hoppalong chef.#br#
 Now, squawk, I will show you my true power!"#br# Mr. Supernatural shrieks proudly.

#&7$Omi##br#
"Sigh... why am I still hearing that squawking?#br#
 Didn't I tell you to go away?#br#
 Don't stick around if you're gonna distract me."#br#
 Omi is focused on cooking. He doesn't even look up.   #M803010s100+30$Omi$1$$1$0#

#&7$Mr. Supernatural##br#
"Squawwwk, ugh. Wait a minute. Squawwk!#br#
 I'm going to teach you a lesson, squawk!#br# Just watch me put on my trousers... Squawwk!#br# Mr. Supernatural's trousers fly away, caught in a sudden gust of wind.
    
   #M026011s50-20$Mr. Supernatural$4$$0$0#

#&7$Mr. Supernatural##br#
"Squaaaaaawk! No, no! Come back, trousers!"#br# Mr. Supernatural frantically chases after the trousers, 
 his cries gradually fading off into the distance. #br# #M026011s50-20$Mr. Supernatural$301$$0$0#

#&7$Omi##br#
"Finally! If it didn't keep quiet, the next dish would have been fried chicken...#br#
 Yeah, that's what I'll make if it ever comes back.#br#
 I've already thought of a name for the dish, even: 'The Babbling Bird'."#br#
 Omi has no idea what just happened. He simply chops up food, talking to himself.   #M803010s100+30$Omi$831$$1$0#|
50530|Omi's on a rampage again, waving knives and planning on killing another of your newfound friends. If you want to save Ironpod from a soupy end, you're going to have to collect Omi the Psychosaur Jaws he's always wanted. Well, at least it'll get you out of this crazy Hoppalong's kitchen.

 Just when you and %p% were rushing to take on a quest,#br#
 out of the blue, you come across a Pincerpod heading determinedly down the street.#br#
 After following it curiously for a bit, you discover its destination seems to be where Omi is cooking.#br#
 That means that maybe the food Omi is cooking drew it in...? #M016010s50+20$Pincerpod$4$$1$0#

#&7$Pincerpod##br#
"Yes? What are you looking at? Never seen someone walk sideways before?#br#
 Didn't anyone tell you it's impolite to stare? The nerve...#br#
 The Pincerpod suddenly stops and addresses you in a fierce tone. #M016010s50+20$Pincerpod$4$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Holy hifalutin mussel-memory! That Pincerpod can TALK!! ...wait a minute!#br# I'm starting to get a very strange sense of déjà vu. A-and its accent is kinda funny,#br# don't you think?" %p% cocks their head sideways in vacuous befuddlement.  
  
  
 %p% looks at you, clearly panicked.#pets100+30$$827$$0$0#

#&7$Pincerpod##br#
"What do you mean, ITS accent? How very rude!#br# I'll have you know I have a name, you know. You can call me Ironpod. 
 And you two brigands, what do I call you?"#br#
 The Pincerpod asks you, looking insulted. #M016010s50+20$Pincerpod$1$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You introduce yourself and %p% to Ironpod.#br#
 As soon as you tell it your name,#br#
 Ironpod seems shocked and stops short.#char$$822$$0$0#

#&7$Ironpod##br#
Well I never! %n% and %p%! I apologize for being short with you.#br# As a matter of fact, I'm a brother to Mr. Supernatural.#br#
 I've heard you two helped him out, so you have my admiration!#br#
 Who would have known that I'd run into you like this? It must be fate." 
     #M016010s50+20$Ironpod$1$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Hahaha, you're too kind.#br#
 But how come you know how to speak, Mr. Ironpod?#br#
 You can't, uh... wear those trousers, can you?"#br#
 %p% asks, confused.#pets100+30$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Ironpod##br#
"It's because of my competitive spirit.#br#
 As my willpower is made of iron,#br#
 if I'm ever up against a stronger opponent#br#
 I can't rest until I've found a way to transcend my limits and outdo them." #M016010s50+20$Ironpod$4$$1$0#

#&7$Ironpod##br#
"Since iron is stronger than chitin, and I don't want to be outdone, I've made myself a #br#
 shell that's stronger than iron. Mr. Supernatural can speak, and since I don't want to #br#
 be outdone by him, I learned to speak too. However, even though Mr. Supernatural can#br#
 fly, I haven't found a way to do so yet. It will take me a few days to figure this out."  #M016010s50+20$Ironpod$4$$1$0#

"So that's why you're called Ironpod.#br#
 What brought you to this village, then?"#br#
 %p% stops, as you realize you've already arrived at Omi's place.#pets100+30$$831$$0$0#

#&7$Ironpod##br#
"I'm here to avenge Mr. Supernatural!#br#
 Whosoever bullies by brother will never be forgiven!#br#
 That maniacal Omi! It's time to make him pay!!!"#br#
 Ironpod suddenly lets out an iron roar, startling Omi, who is carrying a soup pot. #M016010s50+20$Ironpod$301$$1$0#

#&7$Omi##br#
"You guys again? What now...? Huh? A talking... Pincerpod? #br#
 I haven't made a Pincerpod dish...You must have the wrong Hoppalong!"#br# Omi looks confused as he picks up his pot.
  
   #M803010s100+30$Omi$3$$0$0#

#&7$Ironpod##br#
"Enough chatter! Prepare to die!"#br#
 Ironpod roars again, charging at Omi. #M016010s50+20$Ironpod$4$$1$0#

#&7$Omi##br#
"Get away from me! My SOUP! You're going to hit my SOUP! Argh!!"#br# As Omi moves to avoid Ironpod, he loses hold of the pot, sending hot soup flying everywhere.#br# "Oh no! Now look what you've done!! You stupid Pincerpod!!"#br#
 Omi glares angrily at Ironpod, who is now covered in soup.
   
   #M803010s100+30$Omi$827$$0$0#

#&7$Ironpod##br#
"Uhh... my shell suddenly feels chilly... Don't tell me... you've found an ally...?"#br#
 There is a squishy noise coming from Mr. Ironpod, but it seems like he hasn't yet realized#br#
 what's going on. #M016010s50+20$Ironpod$4$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Mr. Ironpod! Your shell, it's melting! The chill is from the wind blowing into it!"#br#
 In a panic, %p% points at Ironpod's shell as the corrosive soup bores a hole into it.#pets100+30$$831$$0$0#

#&7$Ironpod##br#
"That...hateful maniac. What a vicious plot!#br#
 I... I won't surrender so easily..."#br#
 The soup has melted a big hole in Ironpod's shell.#br#
 It's quite the shock to see it.   #M016010s50+20$Ironpod$4$$1$0#

#&7$Omi##br#
"You ! You know how long it took me to make that soup?! Now it's RUINED!#br# All of that work... down the DRAIN! Hmm... perhaps this is just telling me I need#br#
 to try something new. Some Pincerpod Potage, perhaps?" Brightening significantly,#br#
 Omi picks a kitchen knife up off the table.  
   #M803010s100+30$Omi$110$$0$0#

#&7$Ironpod##br#
"Ergh... I'm... getting sleepy. My brother, Mr. Supernatural...#br#  I can't avenge you this time... Please... forgive... me..."#br#
 Ironpod says as he falls to the ground.
  
   #M016010s50+20$Ironpod$502$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You can't help but feel pity for Ironpod, so you decide to help him out of his current predicament.#br#
 You ask Omi what ingredients he's currently missing.#br#
 If he's willing to let Ironpod go, then you'll help collect them.#br#
 Still, you can't help but get a feeling of déjà vu.#char$$2$$1$0#

#&7$Omi##br#
If you can do that, I know just the thing!#br#
 I've wanted to try using #&46$Psychosaur Jaws# in a dish since forever.#br#
 %n%, I'll leave it to you again.#br#
 I'd really like to turn this clumsy crab into a meal, but I can control myself." #M803010s100+30$Omi$831$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Ironpod collapses, breathing weakly.#br#
 Omi glares at him, a mixture of anger and greed in his eyes.#br#
 In order to stop Omi from boiling Ironpod into a soup,#br#
 you should hurry and obtain the ingredients he asked for. #M016010s50+20$Ironpod$1$$1$0#|
50532|#&7$Omi##br#
"Why do so many things happen while I'm cooking these days?#br#
 This is awful. Just wait until I move!#br# I'll find a place with a kitchen I can lock."#br#
 Omi complains, frowning all the while.
   #M803010s100+30$Omi$831$$1$0#|
50533|#&7$%n%##br#
 After you return with the Psychosaur's Jaw that Omi wanted,#br#
 you're surprised to find him polishing Ironpod's shell.#br#
 Ironpod seems to be chewing happily on something placed on a plate in front of him.
 You can't help but feel confused by this turn of events. #M803010s100+30$Omi$2$$1$0#

#&7$Omi##br#
"%n%, %p%, you're back!#br#
 Thanks for getting the ingredients.#br#
 Just put them over there, will ya? I need to finish up here on this shell first."#br# After he finishes talking, Omi returns to his work.#br#
   #M803010s100+30$Omi$4$$1$0#

#&7$Ironpod##br#
"Oh, my two saviors.#br#
 This really is so delicious. Would you like some?"#br# Ironpod uses his massive pincer to pick up a charred piece of something, #br#
 then happily puts it in his mouth. #M016010s50+20$Ironpod$503$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
So...you guys are friends now?"#br#
 %p% seems just as surprised as you are.#pets100+30$$1$$0$0#

#&7$Omi##br#
"Great! That's that, then! It's done.#br# You've just got to be careful from now on, ya hear?#br#
 If anything with that shell goes wrong, come find me."#br#
 Omi jumps off Ironpod's back, then pats his shell.
   #M803010s100+30$Omi$831$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You and %p%look at where the hole was on Ironpod's carapace.#br#
 Omi has managed to completely patch it up using gearcopter parts.#br#
 It looks like patchwork.#br#
 However, Ironpod seems very satisfied with it.#char$$1$$0$0#

#&7$Ironpod##br#
"I really appreciate this, Brother Omi.#br#
 I can't thank you enough for your hospitality."#br#
 Please come visit my house so I have a chance to return the favor."#br#
 Ironpod respectfully gives Omi his thanks. #M016010s50+20$Ironpod$4$$0$0#

#&7$Omi##br#
"It's a deal, as long as there's plenty of delicious things to eat!#br#
 Let's chat next time you're free.#br#
 Can't say I've ever had food made by a Pincerpod before. I'm looking forward to it."#br# In gratitude, Omi shakes Ironpod's pincer.
   #M803010s100+30$Omi$4$$1$0#

#&7$Ironpod##br#
"Well then, I think it is time we parted ways.#br#
 Please take care of yourselves. I'm sure we will cross paths again in the future.#br# I bid you farewell."#br#
 Ironpod says goodbye and scuttles away.
   #M016010s50+20$Ironpod$4$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Um... Omi...#br#
 Can you explain what happened after we left?"#br#
 %p% asks Omi, looking confused.#pets100+30$$1$$0$0#

#&7$Omi##br#
"It was nothing really.#br#
 It's just that Ironpod ate some of the soup I spilled earlier.#br#
 Then he kept asking me if he could try anything else I've made.#br#
 As an expert chef, I couldn't refuse." #M803010s100+30$Omi$4$$1$0#

#&7$Omi##br#
"So I made a bunch of food for him to enjoy. I had some free time after that,#br#
 so I patched up his shell too. That was when you guys showed up, and that's it.#br#
 Nothing weird happened at all. Don't know what all the fuss is about,"#br# Omi says with a dull tone in his voice.  
   #M803010s100+30$Omi$1$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Um... sure, if you say so.."#br#
 %p% mutters, stifling a giggle.#pets100+30$$831$$0$0#|
50540|In order to be a good host for Mr. Bucks, who has come from afar, Omi has decided to prepare a healthy vegetarian meal for this brother of Mr. Supernatural and Mr. Ironpod.

You'll have to go to Echo Mine to find some Gem Blossoms and Echoleaves for Omi's next culinary masterpiece. You're already getting hungry, better get a move on!|
50541|#&7$%n%##br#
 You and %p% pass by Omi's place.#br#
 Neither of you expected to find him confronting a Giant Vinehorn Ram.#br#
 The atmosphere between them is very tense.#br#
 It feels like that it could erupt into a bloodbath any moment now. #M803010s100+30$Omi$1$$1$0#

"Omi... what's this all about?...#br#
 Do you need any help?"

"Hello... there..."#br#
 The Vinehorn Ram suddenly breaks the silence and speaks to you.#br#
 You and %p% are very surprised by this. #M023010s130$Giant Vinehorn Ram$1$$1$0#

#&7$Omi##br#
"What?! You can speak too?#br# Then why the heck did you just sit there staring at me?#br#
 That's a bit creepy, you know?#br#

#&7$Giant Vinehorn Ram##br#
"I'm... sorry...#br#

"Who... no, what creature sleeps with its eyes open?!#br#
 Ah, forget it. Well what can I do for you?#br# Please just tell me you're not looking for trousers or revenge!"#br#
 Omi looks at the Vinehorn Ram with his hands on his hips, clearly annoyed.
   #M803010s100+30$Omi$831$$0$0#

"Allow me to... introduce myself...#br#
 My name is... Mr....Bucks...I am the older brother of Mr. Supernatural... and Mr. Ironpod..."#br# The Vinehorn Ram's voice gradually sinks lower and lower, which is a little hypnotizing.

 All this publicity's a little new for me, you know?#br#

I came... to visit the chef...#br#
 just to have... a good meal... but I must ask...might it be possible...#br#

"It was... a coincidence...#br#

 Lelouch stares at the elated Omi with a deadpan expression.#br#
 Just when he's about to speak, he thinks of something else and keeps his mouth shut.#br#

"Lelouch, Your Majesty... I, I understand.#br#

 You'd never have thought that Lelouch's obscure poetry#br#

"It seems that when someone can't find me,#br#
 they send the packages to Karen instead... Hoho! As a great master once said...#br#
 a wise postman always knows which way the wind turns... Ah yes! Here's one.#br#
 Enkidu finishes rummaging, scoops up a big leaf full of rainwater, and takes a drink. #M813010s100+30$Enkidu$1$$1$0#

#&7$Enkidu##br#
"As for Karen, her fighting skill is truly impressive for a Hoppalong...#br#
 It's such a pity that she, being a noble, cannot focus her time on practicing martial arts...#br#

#&7$Enkidu##br#
"Ah. What I mean is—has their relationship progressed in any way?#br#
 The whole reason we brought Lelouch together with Karen is because we wanted them #br#

"In all seriousness... I cannot imagine them being a couple.

50610|Michaela totally has a crush on Lelouch, but he seems to be ignoring her advances. She asks you to catch her a Faefly, a creature which is said to be able to see into the future.

 Seeing a furious Michaela, ready to strike,#br#
 it seems to know more than to attempt escape, and lands resignedly on the table.#M123010s50$%n%$2$$0$0#

"Hmm, it may be ugly but at least it has good manners.#br#

#&7$Faefly##br#
 Upon hearing the question, the Faefly flies slowly#br#
 to the paper on which is written the word 'No'.#br#

 operating under the name O.M.I. A chemical weapon disguised as food!#br#
 Terrifying. Absolutely terrifying! I'm just glad I didn't partake of it myself.#br# Qyubey gratefully pats her stomach.
   #M802010s100+30$Qyubey$831$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"All things considered, that's pretty accurate. Why don't we just leave it at that?#br#
 %p% giggles to themself. Fortunately, you're the only who hears...
    #pets100+30$$4$$1$0#

#&7$Qyubey##br#
"Upon finding this offending article, I immediately sealed it using wooden boards.#br#
 You would not beLIEVE the stench! I had to take about a dozen baths and scrub#br#
 myself with an iron brush to get rid of it..." Qyubey looks down at the ugly,#br#
 red blotches covering her body. #M802010s100+30$Qyubey$831$$0$0#

#&7$Karen##br#
"Qyubey, actually, I'm a bit ashamed to say this, but... it actually WAS#br#
 supposed to be food. And—try as he might—Omi is not, in fact, a terrorist."#br#
 You can see the corners of Karen's eyes tighten. #M809010s100+30$Karen$4$$1$0#

#&7$Qyubey##br#
"WHAT?! But... but... food should be EDIBLE! This? I thought it would burn#br#
 through the packaging! How could Omi cook something like this and still call it#br#
 FOOD?" Qyubey's eyes blink in rapid succession.
   #M802010s100+30$Qyubey$827$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 It looks like Qyubey hasn't heard about Omi's "culinary talents"—as charitable#br# 
 as it would be to call them as such. You suspect that Omi had invited Qyubey for#br#
 one of his oh-so-frightening "taste tests."
 #char$$4$$1$0#

#&7$Karen##br#
"Quite amusing that you would ask. In fact, Omi has invited Qyubey to taste#br# his food MANY times, but she's always been too busy. That must be why Omi#br#
 sent a sample to Qyubey via the postal service. This would be the first time she's#br#
 been able to experience his 'skills' first-hand."
   #M809010s100+30$Karen$4$$1$0#

#&7$Qyubey##br#
"And I can only pray to the maker that it's the last! Oh, Karen, please! If you#br#
 any heart at all, politely but firmly refuse ANY further tasting requests on my#br#
 behalf? I don't think I could live through another one of those boxes! It's as though#br# they were shipped from the bowels of el Diablo itself!" #M802010s100+30$Qyubey$826$$0$0#

#&7$Qyubey##br#
"Now, if you'll excuse me... I must take my leave, but I  thank you again for all#br# 
 your help..." Qyubey lets out a horrifying frightful sneeze as she turns to leave.
   #M802010s100+30$Qyubey$4$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Wh-why is she sneezing like that? You don't think... it really COULD have#br#
 been a chemical weapon... do you?" %p% fearfully begins checking their own#br#

#&7$Louis##br#
"Well... I've already asked Omi#br#
 to prepare a feast for the occasion.#br#
 But he needs these ingredients. Will you help me collect them?"#br#
 Louis hands you a crumpled list of ingredients. #M804010s100+30$Louis$831$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"O-Omi? Are you sure you want him to do it?#br#
 If your guests are exposed to the food...#br#

"What are you talking about? We're going to be remembering this day fondly all year!#br#
 Please, just collect the things on the list and given them to Omi.

"Where are you taking me?#br#

 Agatha's cold voice rings out behind you.  You turn around and see Louis leading in a disgruntled looking Agatha. #M320090$Agatha$4$$0$0#

 Louis mumbles into his neck. #M804010s100+30$Louis$4$$1$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"Celebrate what?#br#
 What's happening today?#br#
 Is it someone's birthday? Am I getting promoted?"#br#
 Agatha looks around the room, confused. #M320090$Agatha$4$$0$0#

"Well... it's... it's our anniversary... you know of our companionship.#br#

 I... er... you... you're not angry are you?"#br#
 Louis worriedly bows his head. #M804010s100+30$Louis$831$$1$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"Oh? Really? It's been a year already? I had no idea! My, how time flies. Louis, well done."#br# Agatha nods warmly and pats Louis on the head, sending a sly wink in your direction.#br#
 She seems to be hiding something behind her back.  
   
    #M320090$Agatha$4$$0$0#

#&7$Louis##br#
"Wha-? So... so you're... you're...#br# You're not angry?" Louis looks at Agatha, bewildered.
  
   #M804010s100+30$Louis$4$$1$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"What? Angry? Why should I be?#br#
 Do you think I'm some sort of cranky grump?#br#
 I'm not, you know. I got you this. Open it, see if you like it."#br#
 Agatha hands Louis a carefully packaged gift. #M320090$Agatha$4$$0$0#

#&7$Louis##br#
"Oh, it-it's the scarf I've been longing for!#br#
 Agatha... how did you know?"#br#
 Louis lovingly picks up the scarf. #M804010s100+30$Louis$831$$1$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"You've looked at that scarf every time we passed it.#br#
 Doesn't take a genius to guess what you were thinking.#br#
 So, how is it? Feel alright?"#br#
 Agatha asks gently. #M320090$Agatha$4$51$0$0#

#&7$Louis##br#
"I... sob... it's... it's amazing.#br#
 It's so soft... and comfortable... thank you..."#br#
 Tears begin rolling down Louis' face. #M804010s100+30$Louis$822$$1$0#

#&7$Louis##br#
 Gazing at the touching spectacle,#br#
 you also feel happy for them.#br#
 Even though Agatha constantly bullies Louis,#br#
 they seem to have forged a strong bond. #M804010s100+30$Louis$1$$1$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"Alright then. Enough touchy feely stuff. I'm famished.#br#
 I was out running this morning.#br#
 Let's eat!"#br#
 Agatha walks up and opens the lid of Omi's dish. #M320090$Agatha$4$$0$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"What in the world-?! That... that... that SMELL!!#br#
 Louis! %n%! %p%-!! EXPLAIN YOURSELVES!"#br#
 Agatha leaps backwards and roars, one hand covering her nose.
   #M320090$Agatha$4$55$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Sob... we're dead..."#br#
 %p% collapses onto the floor in tears.#pets100+30$$825$$1$0#

#&7$Louis##br#
"It... It's what I asked Omi to cook for us.#br#
 There's plenty for everyone... Just... dig in."#br#
 Louis wipes away his tears and explains with a confused smile. #M804010s100+30$Louis$4$$1$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"Omi cooked this? Are you insane? Louis, are you trying to poison me?#br# How do you expect me to eat something like this? Come here!"#br#
 Agatha grabs a plate of what can only be described as black sludge.
  
   #M320090$Agatha$4$55$0$0#

#&7$Louis##br#
"I... er... is there something wrong?#br#
 Agatha... I don't get it..."#br#
 Louis is slowly realizing that something's wrong.#br# With trembling steps, he moves closer to Agatha. #M804010s100+30$Louis$831$$1$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"Now, eat this! Finish it all.#br#
 THEN tell me it's edible!"#br#
 Agatha grabs Louis in a headlock and begins to#br#violently ram the food into his mouth. #M320090$Agatha$4$$0$0#

#&7$Louis##br#
"Argh, uh, erk! It's... de... li... cious... No... pro... blem..."#br#
 Louis gasps out in between mouthfuls. A treacle-like#br#
 dribble of black sauce streams out the corners of his mouth.   #M804010s100+30$Louis$4$$1$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"Oh, for crying out loud! You're hopeless! Eat this until you die!"#br# Agatha splutters as she continues to stuff fistfuls into Louis' eager mouth.#br# Suddenly she turns to look at you, having momentarily forgotten your presence.
     #M320090$Agatha$4$55$0$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"Oh? You two helped, right? YOU were involved in this... atrocity?#br#
 Well, there's plenty of food to go around. It'd be a pity to see it all go to WASTE.#br#
 Finish it." Agatha pats the table and indicates you to sit down, a horrifying#br# smile etched on her face.

#&7$Louis##br#
"H-h-hey guys.#br#
 Is everything alright? I've finished arranging the spot.#br#
 When the food's done, I'll bring Agatha over."#br#
 Louis excitedly bounces around. #M804010s100+30$Louis$824$$1$0#

#&7$Omi##br#
"You can count on me!
 I'm going to cook up something so nice,#br#
 your grandchildren are going to talk about it. You just wait and see."#br#
 Omi boasts confidently as he continues cooking. #M803010s100+30$Omi$831$$0$0#

"Thank you so much for all your hard work! I'm going to go look for Agatha now.#br#

"Anyway, I've compiled some new ideas for my food.#br#

 #pets100+30$$831$$0$0#

#&7$Omi##br#
"Well of course. Deducing the ingredients of dishes is a food critic's basic skill.#br#
 Moreover, the more food you eat, the more flavors you'll be able to pick out. #br#

50650|Marvin, whose attitude towards you has always been a bit fickle, explains that there have been a shortage of red gems lately. He needs you to collect Beakis Eyeballs.

Beakis and their eyeballs can be found in Ventari Fields. What are you waiting for?|

"Hey Marvin,#br#
 How you doing?#br#
 All good?"#br#
 %p% shouts out a greeting as you're walking past Marvin.#pets100+30$$4$$1$0#

#&7$Marvin##br#
 Upon hearing %p%'s greeting,#br#
   a stoney faced Marvin glances his way,#br#
 Only to immediately look back down and continue working. #M812010s100+30$Marvin$1$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You share looks with %p% and wonder what's eating Marvin.#br#
 You decide to walk over and ask.#br#
 However he gives no indication of having even heard you,#br#
 completely preoccuppied with the red gem clenched in his fist.#char$$1$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Uh... does Marvin seem a little... strange to you?#br#
 I mean he's usually hawking his products at us as soon as he sees us.#br#
 He hasn't said a peep today. Maybe we should come back later."#br#
 %p% shrugs and makes a point to leave.#pets100+30$$1$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Just as you and %p% turn to depart,#br#
 Marvin suddenly jumps to his feet as though he'd been struck by lighting.#br#
 His apathetic face cracks open into a huge grin.#br#
 It's as if you just arrived.#char$$1$$1$0#

#&7$Marvin##br#
"Well if it isn't for my two most treasured customers.#br#
 Just when I was in need of your services,
 poof! You appear in front of me. Just like magic!"#br#
 Marvin exclaims with his arms spread wide. #M812010s100+30$Marvin$4$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Oh hey. You don't seem any different.#br#
 We thought you were having trouble with something."#br#
 %p% breathes a sigh of relief once he gets over his initial shock.#pets100+30$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Marvin##br#
"Oh it's nothing, nothing. Hehehe.#br#
 Now as you know, making money is what I live for.#br#
 Recently, see, an opportunity to make a lovely bit of dough happened to fall into my lap."#br#
 Marvin pockets the gem and begins to rub his hands like a militant germaphobe using Purell. #M812010s100+30$Marvin$831$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"What new business opporunity have you landed this time?"#pets100+30$$831$$0$0#

#&7$Marvin##br#
"Oh a little eager aren't we, %p%? Well then, let me cut straight to the chase.#br#
 I need you to go and collect me some red Beakis Eyeballs.#br#
 As soon as there's a ruby shortage, BAM! I'm there selling a substitute.#br#
 Now time is a wasting, and time is money. Don't want to be wasting any more money now do we?" #M812010s100+30$Marvin$822$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Beakis Eyeballs?
 Are you sure those eyeballs can be used as ruby substitutes?"#br#
 %p% hesitates and asks Marvin.#pets100+30$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Marvin##br#
"Don't you worry your little head about that. They're fine once they're processed.#br#
 As for the payment, well don't worry about that neither.#br#
 With a big seller like this product, you'll get a share. Alrighty then, go get collecting!"#br#
 Marvin shoos you towards the exit. #M812010s100+30$Marvin$831$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You and %p% mumble your farewells as you're jostled out into the streets.#br#
 You're getting a funny feeling about this whole thing,#br#
 but can't quite place a finger on what it is.#char$$2$$0$0#|
50652|#&7$Marvin##br#
"Hmmm... We're going to have to be sure that everyone knows that the substitute has the same luster as a ruby.#br#
 The only problem is its rigidity.#br#
 It wouldn't sell if people thought these were fakes..."#br#
 Marvin mutters to himself as he ponders the issue. #M812010s100+30$Marvin$4$$1$0#|
50653|#&7$Marvin##br#
"Well, well, well. You two never fail to please.#br#
 The amount of Beakis Eyeballs you've bought back...#br#
 I should be able to turn a handsome profit with these. Thanks for the good work!"#br#
 Marvin takes the bag of eyeballs and turns to leave. #M812010s100+30$Marvin$822$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You quickly stop him and as about compensation.#br#
 He slowly turns his head, annoyed by the interruption.#br#
 Suddenly he breaks out a friendly smile.#char$$823$$0$0#

#&7$Marvin##br#
"Oh, and here I was thinking we were becoming friends. Must we talk about money?#br#
 Don't friends help eachother? Tit for tat.#br#
 Don't worry. I owe you one. If you run into any trouble in the future, you come find me.#br#
 I'll find a way to get you out of it." #M812010s100+30$Marvin$831$$1$0#

#&7$Marvin##br#
"Well that's all I needed for today.#br#
 If I don't process these eyeballs quickly, they're bound to go bad.#br#
 We'll meet again next time. Ciao now."#br#
 Marvin rushes off ignoring your calls of protest. #M812010s100+30$Marvin$302$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Dejected, you and %p% decide to leave.#br#
 The more you think about it, the angrier you get.#br#
 Just as you start to loudly voice your concerns with %p%,#br#
 you run into Mholt.#pets100+30$$827$$1$0#

#&7$Mholt##br#
"Oh hey... yeah... Don't be so angry with Marvin.#br#
 That's just how he is, you understand?"#br#
 Mholt butts into your discussion. #M805010s100+30$Mholt$831$$0$0#

#&7$Mholt##br#
"He is very much enthused when there is money to be made,#br#
 Yet he would not give you the time of day if there was no money in it. I say you'd best get used to it."#br#
 Mholt pats %p%'s shoulder consolingly. #M805010s100+30$Mholt$1$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Mholt, do you know whats driving Marvin to make so much money?#br#
 We Hoppalongs are quite self-sufficient,#br#
 Money isn't any sort of necessity."#br#
 %p% is having trouble understanding Marvin's motives.#pets100+30$$831$$1$0#

#&7$Mholt##br#
"That's a question I've asked myself many times before.#br#
 It looked like Marvin had saved up quite a bit at one point,#br#
 but now he seems to have spent most of it. I do wonder where it all went.#br#
 I've asked him on countless occassions, and am yet to have recieved a straight answer." #M805010s100+30$Mholt$831$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You think of the times you hadn't been fully paid by Marvin and mention this.#br#
 Mholt has had the same experience and knows your pain,#br#
 but encourages you to not worry about it too much.#char$$1$$1$0#

#&7$Mholt##br#
"Perhaps Marvin is going through some terrific hardship.#br#
 He does take the trouble to help people, as long as it's in his own interests of course.#br#
 For example, I can only go to him to buy hair-growth formula.#br#
 The other merchants simply don't care..."#M805010s100+30$Mholt$826$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Done speaking, Mholt waves goodbye and leaves.#br#
 You sense some sadness wallowing inside him.#br#
 It makes you think of how he had backed and funded Omi's idea to open a restaurant.#br#
 If there's anything you can say about Omi's dishes, they are powerful. #M805010s100+30$Mholt$4$$0$0#|

 #pets100+30$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Silus##br#
 Silus nods silently and pulls out a slip of paper.#br#
 He points at Eren, then at himself, and then at you.

#&7$%p%##br#
"Does... Eren have something he needs you to tell us?"#br#
 %p% hazzards a guess.#pets100+30$$831$$0$0#

#&7$Silus##br#
 Silus gently nods again and passes on the paper. %p% guess was right on the money.#br# Silus clears his throat and looks down carefully at the paper. After a pregnant pause,#br#
 he turns the paper around. After turning it another time, realization dawns.

#&7$%p%##br#
"Hmm... Whoever wrote this has terrible handwriting...#br# I can't make heads or tails of this..." %p% looks up from the paper at an#br#
 exasperated Silus.

"Pl... please... help... me... go to... Ven-... Venta-... Ventari HILL...#br#

"Th-... th-th-... th-th-th-th-th-thank you... Eren. P.S. Please give... Ssss-sss-ss...#br# Silus some... encouragement... It's really... difficult for him to... s-s-s-sssay so... much..."#br# Silus' face has become a mottled shade of red at this point,#br#

       #M811010s100+30$Silus$1$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Whoa!! That was amazing, Silus! I'm impressed!!#br#
 We've never HEARD you say that many words before!"#br#
 You don't even need Eren's instructions to praise Silus.#pets100+30$$824$$0$0#

#&7$Silus##br#
 Silus sheepishly hands over the Reinforced Manacles,#br#
 seemingly a little embarrassed by the whole ordeal.#br#
 He then bows once in gratitude as you accept the request. #M811010s100+30$Silus$822$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Once you receive the shackles, it hits you that Silus could have just handed #br#
 over the piece of paper. You ask him why he hadn't done so.#br#
 Silus' initial response is a somewhat bewildered stare.#br# His lips tremble as though struggling to say something.#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You wait expectantly for what seems like an eternity. Finally, you and#br#
 %p% give up, figuring you can't take the heavy atmosphere any longer.#br# You make your farewells and prepare to leave. It seems as though it simply#br#
 hadn't occurred to him to pass over the paper.#char$$801$$0$0#|
50662|#&7$Silus##br#
 Somewhat relieved that you've given up, Silus returns to Eren's sleeping#br#
 form, giving the other bunny's head a gentle pat. Just before you're out of#br#
 earshot, you hear him laugh quietly to himself. #M811010s100+30$Silus$1$$1$0#|
50663|#&7$%n%##br#
 Just as you're bringing back the captured Primordiants, Eren wakes up, sitting up with#br#
 a big yawn. He rubs his eyes and smacks his lips as he sleepily acknowledges your arrival.
   #M810010s100+30$Eren$2$$1$0#

#&7$Eren##br#
"Hey, hollah, hey! Look at that! You've caught some Primordiants!#br# That can only mean... Silus actually managed to relay my message!#br#
 Oh, boy! Oh, boy! Is that the truth? Huh? Tell me, is that the truth?!"#br# Eren sheds his drowsiness like a jacket and immediately springs to his feet.  
   #M810010s100+30$Eren$4$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"He did! He did! Silus worked really hard to get your message across.#br# We were so impressed, we didn't even NEED your additional instructions."#br#
 Silus lowers his head in embarrassment, his face turning red.#br#
 #pets100+30$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Eren##br#
"What?! He READ it to you? No WAY! Why'd he do that? I mean, really!#br#
 I assumed he'd just hand over the note! Didn't really need to read it out loud..."#br#
 Eren suddenly jumps up in pain. "Yeeouch! Silus, get your hand away from there!"#br#
"Hey, hollah, hey! Look at that! You've caught some Primordiants!#br#       #M810010s100+30$Eren$827$$1$0#

#&7$Eren##br#
"Owww..." Eren winces as he rubs his hindquarters, then turns his attention back to you. Anyway, you two. Thanks so VERY much! I've been positively swamped by all these#br#
 assignments lately! Haven't had a proper night's rest in who knows HOW long. But#br# now, thanks to you, I was able to replenish my batteries. Eren Hunter is BACK in business!"#br#
  
   #M810010s100+30$Eren$822$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Hey, uh, Eren? What exactly are you going to do with these Primordiants?#br# Just seem like an odd request, is all. I mean, really! Primordiants? What gives?#br#
 You're not, uh... doing something weird with them, are you?"#br#
 The worry is clearly visible in %p%'s eyes.
 #pets100+30$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Eren##br#
"Haha, don't worry! Don't worry. Never you fear. I'M not doing anything with 'em!#br# They're for Karen! As for what SHE plans on doing with them, well..."#br#
 Eren folds his arms, no longer smiling.
   #M810010s100+30$Eren$831$$1$0#

#&7$Eren##br#
 Looking very somber, he lowers his head. "To be honest... I haven't asked her what#br#
she plans on doing with these Primordiants. Didn't WANT to know, actually.#br# But, I, uh... if you really want to know, I can always, you know... ask..."
   #M810010s100+30$Eren$1$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 The sudden change in Eren's demeanor makes the back of your neck tingle#br#
 in apprehension. You're all-too-familiar, now, with Karen's strangely (and #br#
 uncharacteristic) violent side. Perhaps it would be best to just mind your own#br#
 business. You bid your adieus to Eren (and the now grumpy Silus) and take your leave.#char$$801$$0$0#|

 around Lelouch's head before finally landing on his nose. Michaela#br#

"Dear, dear. It seems little Mick is just as shy as ever! That Lelouch! He should consider himself#br#

"Of course! Lead on, young bloods. It's rare to be so inundated with excitement#br# so soon after waking up. I won't be able to rest until I've seen this thing through to#br#

50680|Michaela follows Enkidu's instructions and starts preparing a gift for Lelouch. In a gentle tone that you would never have believed to have come from her, she actually asks for your help!

Having discussed it with Enkidu, Michaela would like you to go to Ventari Hill and collect White Mole Fangs and Sharp Tinderhawk Talons from Sharpfang Moles and Tinderhawks respectively.|
50681|#&7$%n%##br#
 After Enkidu and a delicate Michaela whisper back and forth for a while,#br#
 Michaela meekly waves you over. You can't help but notice that her#br#
 gestures are almost... cute?! You shake your head to rid yourself of the thought. #M807010s100+30$Michaela$4$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Miss Michaela... i-is there something you wanted to tell us?#br#
 We, er, promise not to tell Lelouch about it!" %p% is completely#br#
 taken aback by the new Michaela.#pets100+30$$822$$0$0#

#&7$Michaela##br#
"Well, it's still about sending the gift. Enkidu has given me plenty#br#
 of good suggestions to work off of, but, I, well... there are some things that#br#
 I need your help collecting. Would you two be so kind as to help me out?"#br# As she speaks, she shoots a number of glances at Enkidu, who merely smiles and nods.

#&7$%p%##br#
"I, uhhh... certainly! And, uh, what would Miss Michaela need help collecting?#br#

 they're currently experiencing right, staring at Michaela in awe.#pets100+30$$822$$0$0#

#&7$Michaela##br#
"Oh, please don't, uh, call me 'Miss.' Just... just 'Mick' is fine.#br# A-anyway! I need some white fangs from those Sharpfang Moles#br# and sharp talons from a few Tinderhawks. I would be ever so grateful!"#br#
 Michaela bows in gratitude while you try to stifle %p%'s startled shrieks.

#&7$%n%##br#
 Hearing what Michaela needs, you can't help wonder what sort of contraption#br#
 she's going to make with these sharp objects. Curious, you ask the blushing#br#
 Michaela. She responds with an almost sickly-sweet smile.

#&7$Michaela##br#
"THAT is a secret, but once you bring me the things I need,#br#
 I'd be glad to show you the finished product. Please be patient."#br#

 Mind reeling with possible questions, you depart for the hills.#br#

 You can't help but worry a bit about their mental state.#pets100+30$$827$$0$0#|

#&7$%p%##br#
"Hey, uh... Micha-... I-I mean Mick! We brought back those materials you needed.#br# Let me know if it's enough." %p% cautiously turns over the collected items to Michaela.
  
 #pets100+30$$831$$0$0#

#&7$Michaela##br#
"Wonderful! There's MORE than enough! Oh, thank you BOTH so very much.#br# I'll take it from here." Michaela begins taking out the sharp objects, placing#br#
 them on the ground in a peculiar pattern.
  
   #M807010s100+30$Michaela$822$$1$0#

#&7$Enkidu##br#
"Mick, there's a space open there. And why not move that one here...?#br# Yes—like that. Now, add some water here... Exactly. Good, good...#br#
 The shape is starting to appear... Wonderful. Next, we just need to..."#br# Michaela works on decorating a pot under Enkidu's direction.

#&7$Michaela##br#
"Aaaand done! Enkidu, %n%, and %p%—thank you all. I could never have#br#

#&7$Enkidu##br#
"Oh, pish posh! Thank us upon your return. Hurry now—take the pot to Lelouch.#br#
 We shall remain here, awaiting the news. Good luck!" Enkidu smile warmly.
    
   #M813010s100+30$Enkidu$4$$0$0#

#&7$Michaela##br#
"Yes, Enkidu! I-... I just hope things go all right."#br# Michaela takes the pot and strides away, her#br#
 shoulders straight and her step confident. #M807010s100+30$Michaela$822$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You're still bursting with questions about the pot and its contents, but#br#
 you wait for Michaela to walk some distance away before asking Enkidu why#br# 
 Lelouch would like the pot. Enkidu simply flashes you an unnerving grin.
 #char$$4$$1$0#

#&7$Enkidu##br#
"Oh, I'm not certain at all that he'd LIKE it, but Lelouch will have no other#br#
 choice but to accept it! Just wait and see." Hands behind his head, he sits back#br#
 to await Michaela's return.
   #M813010s100+30$Enkidu$1$$0$0#

#&7$Michaela##br#
"En-Enkidu! I'm back! You were right—Lelouch accepted the gift! Thank you SO much!"#br#
 It's been barely twenty minutes when Michaela comes bounding back, practically#br# skipping in her elation.

#&7$Enkidu##br#
"Didn't I tell you? Years of experience on my side. Oh to be young, frolicking in folly#br# and fantasy. It is truly a time to be treasured, yes? Such a peaceful, wondrous time.#br#
 But come now! What was Lelouch's reaction? How did he respond when you gave#br# him the gift?" Enkidu gives Michaela an encouraging pat on the shoulder.
    
   #M813010s100+30$Enkidu$831$$0$0#

#&7$Michaela##br#
"Well... I-... I, uh... h-he wrote a letter! And asked me to deliver it to you.#br# Please take a look?" Michaela hands a letter—crumpled and damp with#br# sweat from being clenched in her fist—to Enkidu.
   #M807010s100+30$Michaela$4$$1$0#

#&7$Enkidu##br#
"Oh? A letter? Well, well, well..." Enkidu's smile broadens as he unfolds the letter#br# and peruses its contents. Finally, he bursts out laughing. "Oh, my! Oh, MY! Lelouch,#br#
 really! What an adorable little charmer." Finished, Enkidu folds up the letter and#br#
stows it in his pocket.  
   #M813010s100+30$Enkidu$4$$0$0#

#&7$Enkidu##br#
"Well, Mick—I can only help you this once. You're on your own, now. I have faith,#br#
 though, that you'll continue to fight bravely and earnestly. I, however, must bid#br#
 thee all farewell. May our paths cross again." Enkidu walks off, still chuckling#br# to himself.  
   #M813010s100+30$Enkidu$301$$0$0#

"Oh, thank you, Mr. Enkidu! Thank you so much! I understand! I will continue fighting#br#

 until he's nothing more than a dot in the distance. #M807010s100+30$Michaela$822$$1$0#

 Enkidu having left, %p% thinks to console the somewhat forlorn Michaela.#br#
"Hey, Mick. Y-you know, we're here whenever you—OWWOWOWW!!!!"#br#
 Michaela picks up %p% by the ears and shakes them violently in the air.#pets100+30$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Michaela##br#
"Who's this Mic you're talking about? I don't know her! And I'm certain YOU#br# don't know her EITHER! If you do, you'd best forget it! Otherwise I can't be#br# blamed for forgetting my manners!!" Michaela shouts, arms trembling and#br# face flushed with rage.

#&7$Michaela##br#
"What about YOU, %n%? Do YOU know of this 'Mick' your ineloquent companion#br# spoke of?" Michaela stomps towards you with a dangerously stone-cold expression,#br#
 a manic glimmer in her eyes. #M807010s100+30$Michaela$831$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You quickly indicate that you've never HEARD of such a name as you wave your#br#
 hands desperately. Michaela leans in close—so close you can feel the air from her nose. #br#
 Finally, with a "hmph," she turns and leaves as you slump against the wall, defeated.#br#
 The red hot embers on her face, however, would refuse to cool for days.#char$$807$$0$0#|
50690|Lelouch has asked you to deliver a pot to Enkidu. You can't help but notice a striking resemblance between this pot and the one that Michaela had sent earlier.

Lelouch needs you to find Enkidu on Ventari Hill to hand over the pot.|

 Lelouch gingerly picks up the bizarre pot and inspects it in his hands.#br#
 At first glance, you assume it's simply the pot that Michaela had sent him as a gift.#br#
 Upon closer inspection, however, you notice that it's even CRAZIER than the one she'd made.#br#
 Lelouch glances at you hazily before going back to studying the pot. #M806010s100+30$Lelouch$1$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Lelouch, uh, Your Majesty! You seem to have taken quite the liking to that pot, huh?#br#
 It seems Enkidu really DOES know you best..." %p% observes somewhat astutely.
 #pets100+30$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Lelouch##br#
"Enkidu!" Lelouch's eyes widen upon hearing the other Hoppalong's name, and for#br# a moment, he seems to forget his normal demeanor. He quickly recomposes himself.#br#
 "Could thee, perchance, deliver this package of mine? #br#
    Surely t'would not taketh too much of thy time."

#&7$Lelouch##br#
"And what would thee sayeth wast I to taketh one step more—#br#
    That someone in the future would has't needeth of that ore?"#br#

"It gladdens me, cousin, that thee now understandeth#br#    I leaveth the pot, then, to thee, so that thee may delivereth."#br#
 Lelouch blinks once, twice, then goes back to staring into space. #M806010s100+30$Lelouch$822$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"That means... even if the thing itself has no purpose, if you make some kind of#br#
 story about it, THAT will give it meaning... right?" %p% attempts to untangle#br#
 their thoughts as you leave to find Enkidu. Though you don't think they got the#br#
 point at all, the more you think about it, the more you realize there isn't anything to refute?#pets100+30$$4$$0$0#|
50692|#&7$Lelouch##br#

 his mind. It would probably best to leave him alone right now... #M806010s100+30$Lelouch$1$$1$0#|
50693|#&7$Lelouch##br#
 Though it, at first, seemed as though Lelouch was gazing off into the distance, eyes #br#

 he's looking at something nearby. You're just not quite sure WHAT it is, though... #M806010s100+30$Lelouch$1$$1$0#

#&7$Lelouch##br#
 %p%'s voice seems to have shattered—or penetrated—whatever world Lelouch was#br#
 on. He slowly blinks out of his meandering state, turning towards you expectantly.#br#
 From the imploring look of his eyes, you can see he wants to know how Enkidu#br#
 reacted. #M806010s100+30$Lelouch$4$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You explain in great deal how Enkidu still had Lelouch's old pot (though you're#br#
 careful to leave out that Enkidu was not able to make out the meaning of the pot).#br#
 Lelouch nods once upon hearing the news, his face an expressionless mask.#br#
 Somehow, though, you can sense a burgeoning warmth building inside him.#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Lelouch##br#
 Lelouch shifts his gaze to %p%, pointing at their pocket.#br#

 Lelouch nods and takes the rock before carefully placing it in a small, wooden box.#br#
 As he puts his box away,  you see his thoughts—once again—drift off into the distance.
  
   #M806010s100+30$Lelouch$1$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"I-... Hmm, I don't know why, but I feel I'm missing something.#br# It was almost like... like after handing over the rock, I LOST something.#br#

 house the stone.#pets100+30$$826$$0$0#

 You study the aloof Lelouch and think about just how odd his personality is.#br#
 You also wonder how Enkidu and him get along SO well. Their relationship...#br#

#&7$Enkidu##br#
"Hoho! I knew Lelouch would respond this way. Though his thoughts may be#br#
 elusive, sometimes his actions are almost childlike."#br#

#&7$%p%##br#

#&7$Enkidu##br#
"Meaning? Hoho, nothing as serious as all that! Let me show you, and you'll#br# soon see what I mean." Enkidu begins rooting through his rucksack as %p%#br#

   #M813010s100+30$Enkidu$831$$1$0#

#&7$Enkidu##br#
"Tell me, %p%. What is the difference between these two pots?"#br#

"Well... they look... the same! I mean, one's clearly OLDER than the other,#br#

 thorough examination.

#&7$Enkidu##br#
"Well, the old one is a gift from Lelouch to me—from when he began as my student.#br#
 He spent three sleepless nights crafting it, but to this day, I STILL can't figure out why#br#
 he gave it to me." Enkidu lets out a soft chuckle as he reminisces.
   #M813010s100+30$Enkidu$831$$1$0#

"Whaaat? So not even you—Mr. Enkidu—knows?#br# I thought you're supposed to know everything!"#br#

 Almost as shocked as when Michaela went by Mick.#pets100+30$$3$$0$0#  

#&7$Enkidu##br#
"Hoho! Of course, not! I just happen to know a little more than most—that's all.#br# Lelouch, however... he is a puzzle I've not yet been able to fully solve.#br# Which is why I keep this pot as a memento. On occasion, I take it out. I must say,#br#
 it still makes me laugh."
  
   #M813010s100+30$Enkidu$4$$1$0#

#&7$Enkidu##br#
"But I do insist you don't tell Lelouch this—to him, this pot holds a great#br#
 deal of meaning. Were he to find out that I don't fully understand the#br#
 significance of his gift, I'm afraid it would truly hurt him."
   #M813010s100+30$Enkidu$831$$1$0#

#&7$Enkidu##br#
 Enkidu returns the pots to their places and thanks you again for the delivery.#br#
 You, however, leave his place in a state of bewildered frustration.#br#
 Unable to get to any conclusions on your own, you decide to head#br#
 back to Lelouch and tell him what happened. #M813010s100+30$Enkidu$301$$1$0#|

#&7$%n%##br#
 Mholt freezes, brush still in hand as he hears the news. He glances at the formula, then#br#
 at you, before closing his eyes and gritting his teeth, prepared to pour the potion all#br#
 over his body. Without pausing to think, you dart over and swat the formula and brush#br#out of his hands.#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Mholt##br#
"Wh-what are you doing?! Stop that!#br#Mind your own business. I've accepted the risks!!#br#
 I'm willing to..." Mholt's yells die down as you're all#br# suddenly taken by the spectacle that's just taken place.
   #M805010s100+30$Mholt$827$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 The potion had spilled out on a patch of grass, and as soon as it hit,#br#
 the weeds began to shoot upwards, growing at a tremendous rate.#br#
 Once they reached Mholt's height, they disintegrated into a fine powder to be blown away by the breeze.#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Mholt##br#
"What... I... how could... how could this be?#br#
 I...  I... could have died... I've made a huge mistake..."#br#
 Mholt falls to his knees in despair, muttering to himself in disbelief. #M805010s100+30$Mholt$826$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Mholt, good thing you didn't get any on you hey?#br#
 But about this parchment. You need to tell us where you got it.#br#
 How did you come by such a dangerous thing?"
 Mholt takes a bit of persuading from %p%, before he breaks down and begins to explain everything.#pets100+30$$831$$0$0#

#&7$Mholt##br#
"Well today... like every day... I was looking for a formula to grow my hair back.#br#
 I stumbled into an antique pharmacy, and well, that's where I found that bit of paper.#br#
 I was really excitied, and just as I was paying for it, someone swept in and grabbed it from me..."#br#
 Mholt recalls bitterly. #M805010s100+30$Mholt$4$$1$0#

#&7$Mholt##br#
"He was a bald, middle-aged man... befallen to the same misfortune as I. And though we were kindred spirits in this daily struggle,#br#
 my conscience was blinded by desire, and I fought him for the paper...#br#
 In the end... Well, I'm not really sure actually... When I came to, I was at home with the parchment in my hands..."#br#
 Mholt looks down at his shaking hands in a manner that would make Lady MacBeth pround.  #M805010s100+30$Mholt$831$$1$0#

#&7$Mholt##br#
"I think I may have done something bad...#br#
 I took something that was useless to me, from the hands of someone that could have used it...#br#
 And... and... he's just as unfortunate as me! What have I done?! I'm despicable!"#br#
 Mholt hides his face as he begins to cry. #M805010s100+30$Mholt$825$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Hey, shhh, shhhh, Mholt it's okay... I mean, you still have the parchment...#br#
 I'm sure it can be used again right?#br#
 Maybe you'll find that man still lurking around here somewhere. We could go look for him if you want! It'll be just like playing Where's Wally."#br#
 %p% begins spouting anything in an attempt to make Mholt stop crying.#pets100+30$$1$$0$0#

#&7$Mholt##br#
"%p%! You're absolutely right!#br#
 Nothing will come of me just sitting here, feeling sorry for myself!#br#
 I need to work to make amends with my fellow hair impaired bretheren! Hairless of the world unite! We have nothing to lose, and everything to gain!"#br#
 Mholt rolls up the parchment and runs off in search for redemption. #M805010s100+30$Mholt$4$$1$0#

#&7$Eren##br#
"I remember when we snuck out to make a snowman. We got in so much trouble! And#br# Karen was SUCH a crybaby when she was little. She'd always get mad and start crying,#br#

"Since... snowman... same—fever." Silus attempts to explain. You can tell it's#br#

 Silus shakes his head, and you see him struggling internally. Finally, he opens his#br#
mouth again. "#&46$Firefly#... #&46$Snowfield#... #&46$Nautilubus#... #&46$Mucus#—good remedy... worked-...#br#

#&7$Silus##br#
 You see Silus's face fill with relief at the sight, and he quickly takes it from you,#br#
 tipping the filmy substance into a small bowl before giving it a few swirls with#br# 
 his spoon. Reaching into his pouch, he procures a number of small, glass bottles filled#br#with all varieties of powder. #M811010s100+30$Silus$1$$1$0#

#&7$Silus##br#
 Silus empties the powders onto several sheets of medicinal paper and—after carefully#br#
 weighing out the right amounts—adds them to the bowl one after another. #M811010s100+30$Silus$2$$1$0#

#&7$Silus##br#
 As expressionless as ever, he then slowly starts to grind the mixture together.#br#
 The texture is nauseating, and the smell even worse—something akin to week-old#br#
 cheese that's been dipped in Fellswine urine. #M811010s100+30$Silus$831$$1$0#

#&7$Silus##br#
 Once he seems almost finished, he glances up at %p%, giving them#br#

#&7$Silus##br#
"Drink." Silus steps forward and pulls Eren into his arms, thumb and middle finger#br#
 to the other Hoppalong's cheeks to force his mouth open. Before Eren can resist, he#br#
 tips the viscous, green liquid inside. #M811010s100+30$Silus$2$$1$0#

#&7$Eren##br#
"Bllgghh!! Blech! Mmmph!!"#br# Eren wrenches his head free, trying to spit the medicine out, but Silus just#br#

 %n% and I will do whatever we can to help."#br#
 %p% bows to Michaela politely.#pets100+30$$822$$0$0#

#&7$Michaela##br#
"I've been so busy with quests these days#br#
 that I haven't had time to take proper care of my hair,#br#
 and it's lost its beautiful sheen. It's just dry and frizzy and... just plain blah.#br#
 How can I tell everyone I'm the most beautiful Hoppalong in all the land with these basic bangs?" #M807010s100+30$Michaela$825$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You look at Michaela, then at %p% ...#br#
 Michaela complains about her dull hair,#br#
 but it still looks like spun gold next to %p%'s droopy locks.#char$$826$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"What are you looking at? Is there something on my face?"#br# Feeling your eyes on his hair, %p% turns and looks suspiciously at you.
 #pets100+30$$4$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Not wanting to mention to %p% what you were just thinking,#br#
 you quickly change the subject, asking Michaela#br#
 if she knows a way to restore the condition of her hair.#char$$821$$0$0#

#&7$Michaela##br#
"Well, since you asked... could I make an official request?#br#
 I desperately need #&46$some Icecrystal Snapper Meat from Frostbite Forest#!#br#
 It has youth-restoring properties. It's a bit gross at first, but it's totally worth it!" #M807010s100+30$Michaela$822$$1$0#|
50792|#&7$Michaela##br#
"I'm so sorry I've neglected you, my friend,"#br#
 Michaela moans as she combs her hair. #M807010s100+30$Michaela$826$$1$0#|
50793|#&7$Michaela##br#
"My poor hair..."#br#
 Michaela combs and combs, but nothing seems to be improving. #M807010s100+30$Michaela$826$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Michaela, I'm sorry I kept you waiting."#br#
 %p% delivers the Icecrystal Snapper Meat to Michaela.#pets100+30$$822$$0$0#

#&7$Michaela##br#
"Oh my! How wonderful! Look how much you managed to gather! You're so considerate!#br# At long last, my hair can return to its former glory, and peace will be restored! #br# Well, maybe not peace in a worldwide sense, but, you know, my own personal peace."#br#
 After sizing up the meat, Michaela transfers it all into a bowl. #br#
  
   #M807010s100+30$Michaela$4$$1$0#

#&7$Michaela##br#
"Now I just have to smash it into a paste, and presto!"#br#
 Michaela begins to crush the snapper meat with a pestle,#br#
 really getting into it. #M807010s100+30$Michaela$831$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Michaela's stronger than she looks, especially when it comes to smushing fish meat into paste.#br#
 If Enkidu could see this, he might change his mind#br#
 about Karen being the top Hoppalong fighter.#char$$806$$0$0#

#&7$Michaela##br#
"And... done!
 Now to apply it to my body..."#M807010s100+30$Michaela$824$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Huh? You mean, you don't eat it?"#br##pets100+30$$3$$0$0#

#&7$Michaela##br#
"Of course not, silly! Where'd you get that idea?"#br#
 Michaela looks at %p% , somewhat dismayed at his ignorance,#br#
 apparently assuming that fish flesh is a widely used hair product. #M807010s100+30$Michaela$2$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Applying Snapper Meat... that reminds you...#br#
 You recall that Mholt used Sharkicane flesh, thinking it would thicken his hair.#br#
 You can't help but ask Michaela if a Sharkicane's meat is also effective.#char$$821$$0$0#

#&7$Michaela##br#
"Oh? %n%, you know about that, too? Sharkicane makes a great conditioner. Nothing beats it!#br#
 The only downside is that you have to keep replacing it with fresh meat.#br#
 That can be a real chore, so I settle for the next best thing and use Icecrystal Snapper Meat,#br#
 which is much more convenient. They both smell about the same, though." #M807010s100+30$Michaela$4$$1$0#

#&7$Michaela##br#
"Now that you mention it,#br#
 Mholt once asked me how I kept my hair so shiny and beautiful,#br#
 and I recommended applying Sharkicane meat."#br#
 Pleased with herself, Michaela nods confidently. #M807010s100+30$Michaela$831$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You smirk just a little,#br#
 thinking about Mholt mistaking a conditioning treatment for a hair loss remedy.#br#
 Well, at the very least, the hair he does have will be smooth and silky,#br#
 though it'll probably stink of old fish for a while.#char$$826$$0$0#|
50800|Omi has just heard about a legendary kitchen god who left some cookware in Frostbite Forest. He is resolved to go find them, even though he has no idea where they are, or even what they are! 

To stop Omi from foolishly heading out into the bitter cold alone, you decide to search Frostbite Forest for the items yourself. It sounds like a waste of time, but it's still better than letting him go freeze to death, and who knows, maybe something is out there. At least it couldn't possibly make his cooking any worse...|
50801|#&7$%n%##br#
 Omi's eyebrows knit together in concentration; he's got something important on his mind, it seems.#br#
 Upon closer inspection, you notice he's grasping a letter in his hand,#br#
 and you guess that it has something to do with his determined expression. #M803010s100+30$Omi$1$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Omi, you seem a little distracted.#br#
 Is there something on your mind?"#pets100+30$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Omi##br#
"Oh no... If you can tell just by looking at me,#br#
 it must be bothering me even more than I realize,"#br#
 Omi mutters sullenly. #M803010s100+30$Omi$826$$1$0#

#&7$Omi##br#
"You see, there's a chef I competed against recently...#br#
 You probably don't remember.#br#
 Well, anyway, we've become pen pals."#br#
 Omi scratches his head, a little embarrassed. #M803010s100+30$Omi$1$$1$0#

#&7$Omi##br#
"In a letter he wrote to me, he spoke of an age-old legend...#br#
 There was once a chef blessed with such skill that he was elevated to the level of kitchen god.#br#
 Like, an actual god! Can you imagine? God of whisks and flour and measuring cups!" #M803010s100+30$Omi$4$$1$0#

#&7$Omi##br#
"Anyway, when he retired from his god-dom,#br#
 he left behind some of his cookware,#br#
 and they say anyone who gets his hands on this #&46$legendary cookware##br#
 can also become a kitchen god!" #M803010s100+30$Omi$831$$1$0#

#&7$Omi##br#
"However, nobody really knows what kind of utensils they are, or where they're hidden...#br#
 The details are a bit sketchy... After all, it's a legend, so there's not exactly concrete proof."#br#
 Omi shakes his head excitedly,#br#
 his eyes glazed over in a dreamy haze. #M803010s100+30$Omi$826$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Becoming a kitchen god... magical legendary cookware...#br#
 it all sounds pretty ridiculous to you, honestly,#br#
 but it's clear from Omi's expression that he's utterly convinced the legend is true.#char$$806$$0$0#

#&7$Omi##br#
"But! My pen pal claims#br#
 that a piece of the cookware can be found in #&46$Frostbite Forest#!#br#
 Though he doesn't know where, exactly, it's still an exciting development.#br#
 We've got to find it!! Come on!" #M803010s100+30$Omi$827$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Finding these cooking utensils, without any idea what they look like or where they might be?#br#
 That will be like finding a needle in a haystack! You try your best to dissuade Omi.#char$$826$$0$0#

#&7$Omi##br#
"I don't care what you say! This is my dream! There must be a way to find them.#br#
 Perhaps they're buried in the Snowfield somewhere, or there could be #br#
 a few pieces in the belly of a #&46$Chillizard#! #br#
 I simply can't BEAR not knowing!!"   #M803010s100+30$Omi$825$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"%n% , %n%, I can't handle seeing Omi so torn up.#br#
 Unless we step in and do something, there's no way he'll let the matter rest!#br#
 He might end up doing something foolish. He could really hurt himself out there in the cold,"#br#
 %p% quietly tells you, concern in his eyes.#pets100+30$$831$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 It's true; %p% is right. To prevent something terrible from happening to Omi,#br#
 you decide to help him by heading to #&46$Frostbite Forest# to search for #&46$the legendary cookware#.#br#
 Maybe if you pry open a few #&46$Chillizards# and peer inside, Omi will abandon his quest. #char$$826$$0$0#|
50802|#&7$Omi##br#
"It's fantastic that you've agreed to help me look for the legendary cookware!#br#
 But be sure not to leave any stone unturned... Don't forget the Snowfield! #br# Check the holes in the tree trunks!
 And... and inside the Chillizards' bellies!" #M803010s100+30$Omi$824$$1$0#|
50803|#&7$Omi##br#
"Legendary cookware..."#br#
 Omi giggles, seemingly lost in thought. #M803010s100+30$Omi$824$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Omi! We're baaaaaack! But all we found was this rusty old kitchen knife."#br# Somewhat embarrassed, %p% unsheathes the kitchen knife.
  
 #pets100+30$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Omi##br#
"You... you found this in Frostbite Forest?#br#
 Let me see! Give it here!"#br#
 Not prepared to admit defeat, Omi carefully inspects the shabby knife. #M803010s100+30$Omi$831$$1$0#

#&7$Omi##br#
"Hmm, very interesting. Interesting, indeed."#br#
 Suddenly, as Omi grips the knife,#br#
 a dazzling light bursts forth from it,#br#
 illuminating the entire room. #M803010s100+30$Omi$3$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Omi suddenly finds a brand new, exquisitely crafted kitchen knife gleaming in his hand.#br#
 The rusty knife has been utterly transformed.#char$$825$$0$0#

#&7$Omi##br#
"Ha! I told you! I knew it! It's the legendary cookware! It's real! It's real!"#br#
 Omi has no misgivings whatsoever about the strange event that just occurred.#br#
 He gazes admiringly at the fine kitchen knife before him, a satisfied smile on his face.  #M803010s100+30$Omi$824$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"It's not possible! Let me take a look at that knife!"#br#
 %p% carefully takes the knife from Omi.#pets100+30$$824$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Wait a minute. What happened?"#br#
 As soon as the knife leaves Omi's hand,#br#
 the dazzling light disperses,#br#
 and the knife abruptly reverts to the rusty old thing it once was.#pets100+30$$3$$0$0#

#&7$Omi##br#
"It's all true! This knife is destined to be used only by a genuine chef!"#br#
 As soon as Omi takes back the knife,#br#
 it once again emits its dazzling white light,#br#
 turning into a fine, sharp new kitchen knife once more! #M803010s100+30$Omi$831$$1$0#

#&7$Omi##br#
"This is incredible! Thank you so much for finding it!#br#
 I'll be a real kitchen god in no time flat! Wooooooooo!"#br#
 Omi shouts wildly, brandishing the knife.#br#
 You take a step away, worried that if he gets any more excited, you might lose a finger or two. #M803010s100+30$Omi$824$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Could the legend really be true?#br#
 Though Omi is nearly bursting with joy, you still have some misgivings about the whole thing...#br#
 It seems you'll need to keep a close eye on any further developments.#char$$826$$0$0#|

"Today is definitely not Marvin's day..."#br#

#&7$%p%##br#
 %p% looks in the direction of Doreen's gaze but doesn't see anything.#br#
"Doreen, what makes you say that?"#br#
 %p% turns and asks Doreen.#pets100+30$$831$$0$0#

#&7$Doreen##br#
"I just saw Michaela storming over to #&46$Marvin's store#. They have... shall we say... history....#br#
 And let me tell you, you would NOT like Michaela when she's angry!"#br#
 Doreen shudders as if imagining a charging Fangsaur.  #M815010s100+30$Doreen$831$$1$0#

#&7$Doreen##br#
"I bet it has something to do with Marvin's harebrained idea.#br#
 He suggested that Michaela take a Pantherus as a pet, so she did,#br#
 and for several days, the people of Elysium were too frightened to leave their homes!"#br#
 Doreen shakes her head, attempting to look gravely serious while stifling a giggle. #M815010s100+30$Doreen$2$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#

 it was actually you and %p% who carried out the plan#br#.

"%n% and %p%,#br#
 sorry for keeping you waiting." #M308060$Angel$822$$1$0#

#&7$Angel##br#
"Thank you both for all your hard work in completing half of the assignment.#br#
 The Mothrake Pupae have already been turned into silk.#br#
 I've made a package for you. Go ahead, take it!"#br#
 Angel passes you a faintly glowing parcel. #M308060$Angel$4$$1$0#

 You accept it and thank Angel.#char$$821$$0$0#

50930|Poor Simón made the mistake of a lifetime—telling Michaela that Faeflies are capable of seeing into the future! They're not, of course, but Michaela seems intent on finding one all the same.

As Michaela's already hopped her way to the Ventari Fields in search of the elusive Dragomon, Simón asks you to hurry and stop her before she can commit Faeflyicide!|
50931|#&7$Simón##br#
"Well, I mean... it is, of course, not really that important, no? It's just, well... old Simón may have#br# told a mentira piadosa. A white lie, if you will. You see, I read a little bit about this 'divination'#br#
 galimatías and maaaaay have stretched the truth a little bit in how much I was knowing.#br# So Michaela came to me asking me to teach her! ¡Ay, caramba!"#br#
  
  
   #M825010s100+30$Simón$826$56$1$0#

#&7$Simón##br#
"When she asked, my-... my mind went totally black! ¡Más oscuro que boca de lobo!#br# I could not remember anything from the book! So, I... I may have told her some loco#br#
 story about how Faeflies can divinate and all that, yes? Now, what have I done?!#br#
 I have unleashed the diablesa on those poor, innocent creatures!" Simón tugs on his ears.
    
   #M825010s100+30$Simón$827$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"So... what you're saying is you need someone to bring Michaela back before#br#
 she does something stupid like use a Faefly for her own warped divination purposes?"#br#
 %p% cocks their head to the side in somewhat vacuous inquiry.#pets100+30$%p%$831$$0$0#

#&7$Simón##br#
"¡Sí, my lapine pana! ¡Sí! Think of those poor creatures! She will have her way with#br# them like a child burning ants with a magnification glass! I do not know who else to#br#
 turn to, %n%! Please! Surely, she will not give YOU any trouble, no? What can I say?#br#
 She's not exactly a full-course meal, if you know what I mean!" Simón elbows you in the side.

#&7$%p%##br#
"All right, all right! We'll see what we can do. Shouldn't be that hard, right, %n%?#br#
 Simón, you sit tight here. We'll be back before you know it!"#br#
 You and %p% wave goodbye to Simón before heading off to find a certain pompous Hoppalong...

"Oh, those poor creatures. They remind me of the days of my youth.#br#
 When I was but a boy, and I had not a care in this big, giant world.#br#
 Yo vide una garza mora..." Simón begins singing softly to himself, voice trembling.#br#
 You decide to leave him alone. #M825010s100+30$Simón$826$$1$0#|
50933|#&7$Simón##br#
"%p%! You are back! Oh, please! ¡Por favor! You must tell me how things went! I have#br#
 been sitting here ¡más cagado que palo de gallinero! It was horrible! Simply horrible!#br# That vicious diablesa did not try anything, did she? The Faeflies! You must tell me#br#
 they are all right!" Simón clasps his palms together and falls to his knees in front of you.#br#
   #M825010s100+30$Simón$831$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You relay everything that happened in the fields (carefully leaving out anything#br#
 you fear could make the poor venezolano have an aneurysm), and once you're finished,#br#Simón heaves a sigh of relief.#char$$821$$0$0#

#&7$Simón##br#
"¡Gracias a Dios! You do not know how soothing that is to my poor, tortured soul!#br#
 You have saved a life today, mi pana! Truly, you are a saint amongst men! Come here,#br#
 you gato loco, and give old Simón some amapuche, yes? You and I need to catch up sometime!#br# We will have a good time! Come see me! ¡Adiós, adiós!" Simón trots off with a wave of his hand.

#&7$%p%##br#
"¡Adiós, Simón!"#br#

 Delphia, who seems to have finally finished sorting out her#br#onslaught ofwork, notices the two of you and wanders over.#pets100+30$%p%$4$$0$0#

#&7$Delphia##br#
"How are things fairing, you two? You haven't had any new issues crop up, I hope.#br#
 With all the strange things that have been happening, I can't help but worry..."#br#

50940|Doreen is very curious about the gift Michaela wants to give to Lelouch! And by "very curious," we meant "about to explode from lack of knowing." Save the poor woman from internal combustion by finding Michaela pronto and solving the mystery!

Michaela was last spotted on her way to Ventari Hill with the other Hoppalongs, so you'll to hop-skip your way to the nearest gearcopter to get there...|
50941|#&7$Doreen##br#
"How WONderful! I just knew you say that, %p%. And really, I wouldn't#br# ask unless it was a dire, dire emergency... WHICH IT IS! Michaela plans on#br#
 sending Lelouch some kind of gift! I MUST know what it is! Do you understand?#br#
 It's keeping me up at night! I can't even sleep thinking about what it could beeee..."
   #M815010s100+30$Doreen$822$51$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Michaela's gifts DO tend to be... different. They look normal at first glance,#br#
 but upon closer inspection, end up being some kind of lethal weapon that'd#br#
 kill you in your sleep if you put it next to your bed." %p% shivers and shakes their ears.#br#
 #pets100+30$%p%$831$$0$0#

#&7$Doreen##br#
"I simply must know what it is or I'll go CRAZY! Surely, you can understand#br#
 the plight of a woman in need? And going to her directly is out of the question!#br# I need someone on the inside. Someone who could investigate the gift's origins#br#
 without arousing suspicion..." Doreen's eyes narrow as they turn towards you.
   #M815010s100+30$Doreen$824$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Well, I mean, we can try, right? Michaela's always having us do one thing#br#
 or another for her! Maybe if we ask to help she'll let us in on the secret, too.#br#
 Then again, if she's in a bad mood or something..." %p%'s face pales.
 #pets100+30$%p%$826$$0$0#

#&7$Doreen##br#
"Oh, perfect! You're oh-so-right, %p%! Simply ask if there's any way you can assist her#br# in that ever-willing-to-please manner you're so good at, and she's sure to accept your#br#
 help! I can't see this plan going horrible wrong at all! Ah, and while you're at it, could you#br#
 check in with #&46$Mholt and Eren#, too? I haven't heard from them in a while."
  
   #M815010s100+30$Doreen$825$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Never fear! We'd never let you succumb to the horrors of monotony!#br#
 We'll be back in two shakes with more juicy gossip than you can shake a stick at!"#br#
 The two of you bid your adieus before setting your course towards Ventari Hill...#pets100+30$%p%$4$$0$0#|
50942|#&7$Doreen##br#
"I must say, I never knew Michaela was quite so taken by the young prince.#br#
 Michaela's always in a foul mood, and Lelouch is a little, well, shall we say 'dense?'#br#
 I can't even imagine how the two of them would interact, let alone begin any sort of...#br#
 of... reLATIONship!" Doreen shakes her head, tiny brows furrowed. #M815010s100+30$Doreen$831$$1$0#|
50943|#&7$Doreen##br#
"Oh! %n% and %p%! You're back at last! I simply#br#
 MUST know! What is it? What was the gift? TELL ME!"#br#
 Doreen practically climbs atop your shoulders in her excitement.
   #M815010s100+30$Doreen$824$51$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Well, erm, it's kind of a long story..." %p% makes themselves comfortable#br#
 atop the nearby step and motions for Doreen to join them before continuing.#pets100+30$%p%$831$$0$0#

#&7$Doreen##br#
"Hmm... interesting. VERY interesting. But that still explains nothing!#br#
 Lelouch is, well, different from the other Hoppalongs. But I suppose it's#br#
 better than nothing. A girl can't be choosy, after all." Doreen bows her head#br#
 politely, but you can tell it's still eating away at her inside.
   #M815010s100+30$Doreen$822$$1$0#|
50950|As impossible as it may seem, Louis has been even MORE depressed lately. To the point where even Agatha is fed up with his moping! She wants you to find out what's got her crestfallen companion so down in the dumps, which means going straight to the source—the other Hoppalongs.

Last you heard, they were on their way to Everfrost Berg. Better pack your snowshoes!|
50951|#&7$Agatha##br#
"%n%! There you are. I have to ask you a question. It's regarding, erm, personnel#br#
 issues. Louis has been acting even more depressed than usual lately. Normally, I#br#
 wouldn't think much of it, but it's getting to the point where I hate taking him anywhere#br#
 with me! You seem like more of a people person, so I thought I'd ask you." #M320090$Agatha$4$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You're not sure if letting Agatha know that she herself is the cause of 99% of Louis's #br#
 anxiety problems (and why he has enough self-esteem issues to fill up a therapist's#br#
 notebook two times over). As doing so seems potentially hazardous to all parties involved,#br#you instead decide to shrug and say you haven't the foggiest.#char$$826$$0$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"Well, I need to know! I can't go around threatening people if I'm being followed by#br#
 some bump on the log who'd just as soon cry as say hello! Find out for me, %n%!#br#
 It's what I pay you for, isn't it?"#br#
 You think it wise not to bring up the fact that you're not paid anything. #M320090$Agatha$821$$1$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"Come to think of it, I haven't heard ANYthing from the other Hoppalongs as of late. #br# You know, like those #&46$two twins#—I forget their names, but that one is SO annoying!#br#
 Or that one with the #&46$vacant eyes# who barely seems to understand English.#br#
 Maybe there's something going on! And that's why Louis is upset..."
   #M320090$Agatha$4$$1$0#|
50952|#&7$Agatha##br#
"I'll bet you anything those other Hoppalongs have something to do with this!#br#
 I've never trusted them! Bunnies! Why'd it have to be BUNNIES?!"#br#
 Agatha shivers and walks off, rubbing her arms. #M320090$Agatha$821$$1$0#|
50953|#&7$%n%##br#
 You fill in Agatha about what happened with the Hoppalongs at the berg. She's#br#
 surprisingly quiet as she listens, taking in your every word, silently chewing her#br#
 bottom lip, and when you've finished, she nods her head resolutely, as though having#br#reached an acceptable conclusion.#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"It's the snow! That must be it! Yes." Agatha shakes her head with a sigh.#br#
 "The other Hoppalongs went to play in the snow, but they didn't invite Louis to#br#
 go play with them! It all makes sense now. Why couldn't I have seen it earlier?"
   #M320090$Agatha$4$$1$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"He must really like the snow... You think if I take some assignments over on the western#br#
 continent, it'd, I don't know, put a skip in his step? Do Hoppalongs even skip? Aw, whatever!#br#
 Why didn't he just tell me? Keep me worrying like this for nothin'? Next time I see him,#br# I'll... I'll...!" Agatha sighs and begins reading through a list of available assignments.
   #M320090$Agatha$821$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
All of a sudden, %p% tugs on your sleeve, big, round eyes imploring.#br#
 "%n%? I-I'm so glad YOU'RE my companion..."#pets100+30$%p%$831$$0$0#|
50960|Qyubey heard Louis has been binging on sweets, and she fears he might be developing a severe case of sugar dependence. She wants you to find out if it's true or not and save the poor bun before his teeth rot and fall out.

Seems he and the rest of the Hoppalongs have recently left for Frostbite Forest. Time to chill... literally!|
50961|#&7$Qyubey##br#
"%n%! %p%! Just the two people I was hoping to see. Could you perhaps#br# join me for a moment? I have a... somewhat sensitive matter to discuss with"#br#
 you..." Qyubey pops out from behind a nearby wall and beckons you over. #M802010s100+30$Qyubey$821$$1$0#

#&7$Qyubey##br#
"It's just, well..." Qyubey glances around anxiously before continuing.#br#
 "I need you to look into something for me. Or, to be more honest, someONE.#br#
 I believe Louis may have come down with an insatiable addiction to sweets!#br#
 The poor boy is liable to lose all of his TEETH at this rate! It's... troubling." #M802010s100+30$Qyubey$831$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Sweets? Like candy? Cake? Chocolate? Are we talking about the same Louis?#br# The Louis who'd just as soon cry as say hello?" %p%'s eyes narrow dubiously.#br#
 "Then again, maybe he's reached a new low and is gorging himself on sweets to forget#br#his troubles."#br#
 %p% ponders anxiously.#pets100+30$%p%$826$$0$0#

#&7$Qyubey##br#
"Shhhhh! Not so loud! Look, I only know what I heard from someone else, but#br# if it's really as bad as they've made it out to be, something must be done! I'm afraid#br#
 afraid that if I try to confront the boy directly, it will only upset him even more!#br#
 So I was, well, hoping YOU could perhaps covertly #&46$investigate the issue#?"#br#
   #M802010s100+30$Qyubey$831$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Well, we can certainly try! Can't say I've ever been given a mission like this before...#br#
 But we'll do our best to see to it that Louis won't be getting ANY cavities!#br#
 %p% nods resolutely, like some kind of tiny, long-eared tooth fairy.
 #pets100+30$%p%$822$$0$0#

#&7$Qyubey##br#
"There's no way to know for certain this addiction isn't contagious, so could you#br#
 check up on #&46$Lelouch, Mholt and Omi#, too? Make sure they haven't started#br#
 exibiting symptoms! Like... a suspiciously high tolerance to sugar buzz. Or withdrawal!#br# You know, shaking, sweaty, increased irritability—all that kinda stuff!"
   #M802010s100+30$Qyubey$821$$1$0#|
50962|#&7$Delphia##br#
"You wouldn't happened to have seen Louis, would you have, %n%?#br#
 Agatha's mentioned he keeps running off to who-knows-where, and even#br#
 when he comes back, he keeps acting strangely... shifty. Have you noticed"#br#
 anything? It does strike me as rather odd." Delphia tilts her head in puzzlement. #M327090$Delphia$4$$1$0#|
50963|#&7$Qyubey##br#
"How-... how is he, Doc? Say he's all right! Say it's just a phase!"#br#
 Qyubey rushes forward as soon as you and %p% approach. #M802010s100+30$Qyubey$831$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Oh, Qyubey! There's really nothing to fret about! Seems this was all just one big#br#
 misunderstanding—a case of chocolate cake gone bad, if you will. None of the#br#
 Hoppalongs are developing sugar dependencies! THAT, I can assure you.#br#%p% laughs to themself as the memories from earlier resurface.#pets100+30$%p%$831$$0$0#

#&7$Qyubey##br#
"Thank the maker! I was half-worried I'd come back one day and find nothing#br#
 but chaos! Raving, wild Hoppalongs begging for sugar in the streets. Underground#br#
 sweets societies... you name it! Glad I was able to get this whole thing cleared up."#br#
 Qyubey shudders as said images manifest themselves in her mind. #M802010s100+30$Qyubey$822$$1$0#

#&7$Delphia##br#
"Hm? Miss Qyubey! What a delight. I hadn't even noticed you here.#br# Though I must say—it's rare to see you pay a visit to the Falcon's Nest#br#
 without reason. Nothing is the matter, is it?"#br# Delphia approaches the three of you, a note of concern lingering in her voice.
   #M327090$Delphia$4$$1$0#

"Fret not, dear. After all, hunting can be an incredibly dull business, and many#br#
 of us—yours truly included—simply enjoy a change of pace every now and again.#br#
 Keep things interesting, you know?" Karen shoots you a sly wink. #M809010s100+30$Karen$821$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You chuckle awkwardly, but respond with a smile and a quick nod.#char$$821$$0$0#

#&7$Karen##br#
"Actually, children, you've arrived at an incredibly opportune time. Though I hate to burden#br#
 you so on our first meeting, I had hoped you might do me the most miNUTE of favors..." #M809010s100+30$Karen$1$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You reply that you'd be more than happy to assist her with whatever needs doing.#br#You're an honorable hunter, after all!#char$$821$$0$0#

#&7$Karen##br#
 Karen procures a rather fancy-looking #&46$water bottle# from her pack and gives it to you.#br#
"WONderful, dear. I knew I could count on you. Now, what I need you to do is fill this#br#
 #&46$water bottle# and take it to my darling brother #&46$Eren# further along the bay. Could you#br#do that?" #M809010s100+30$Karen$831$$1$0#

#&7$Karen##br#
"Do forgive his uncouth manners, if you would. Hard to believe as it is, the two of us are#br#
 actually twins. Perhaps some of his companion, Atelia, has rubbed off on him. At any rate,#br#you'll find him over by #&46$Gullwing Port#. I would imagine you'll have no trouble locating him." #M809010s100+30$Karen$822$$1$0#|
50982|#&7$Eren##br#
"I thought all they had to do was take down some nasty critters causing a ruckus by#br#
 the village, huh? Yeah! What's takin' them so long? They... they couldn't have run into#br# trouble, could they have? COULD THEY HAVE? Oh, Silus! Oh, god, SILUS!"#br#Eren weeps silently into his paws. #M810010s100+30$Eren$825$$1$0#

#&7$Eren##br#
All of a sudden, his demeanor changes, and he glances up with a start.#br#
 "Silus and Lenora make a pretty good team, though. I mean, he doesn't like#br# to talk. She doesn't like to talk. They'd have so much to not talk about! Like#br# two brooding peas in a pod, yeah? They should be fine, yeah! They should be fine!" #M810010s100+30$Eren$827$$1$0#|
50983|#&7$Eren##br#
"Hah? Who're you bozos? Got somethin' you need from the great Eren?"#br#
 The Hoppalong in front of you bears an uncanny resemblance to Karen.#br#Well, in every way except his manners, that is...#br#He gives you and %p% a thorough once-over while picking at something in his teeth. #M810010s100+30$Eren$831$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Just as you're about to introduce yourself, Eren's ears perk up, and he interrupts you with a laugh.#char$$821$$0$0#

#&7$Eren##br#
"Wait, wait, wait... I know YOU! You're that flashy new hunter Bain's gotten himself#br#
 all twitterpated with! HA! S'pose I can't blame him. You're not bad on the eyes! Then#br#
 again, I'd almost say you're TOO baby-faced. You're not one o' them rich kids who#br#bribed their way to the top, are ya?" #M810010s100+30$Eren$821$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You're unsure whether to be flattered or offended.#br#Before you can decide, Eren interjects again, flapping his ears.#char$$821$$0$0#

#&7$Eren##br#
"Hyuck, hyuck, hyuck! Don't look so agog, kid. I was just joshin' with ya! Everyone knows#br#
 Bain's got the personality of a fart in the wind! You can barely get him to SMILE let alone#br#
 give in to some buckaroo's salacious scheming. Probably wouldn't even know how to#br#
 react, that one. Anyways, what can I do ya for? You need something from yours truly?" #M810010s100+30$Eren$831$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You slide the water bottle out from your pack, about ready to hand it over, when Eren#br#abruptly snatches it from your hand with a high-pitched whistle.#char$$821$$0$0#

#&7$Eren##br#
"Hey, hollah, hey! So that sweet sister of mine asked you to bring me water, did she? Ain't she#br#
 the best? Goll, kind of embarrassing, actually. I'm the one who popped out first! I should be#br#
 the one carin' after her 'n all. Bah, she keeps saying I talk too much. Always trying to make sure#br#
 sure my throat stays hydrated! But I don't talk THAT much, do I? But I don't talk THAT much, do I? Do I?" #M810010s100+30$Eren$825$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You're fairly certain that as soon as you start talking, the hyperactive Hoppalong will#br#simply interrupt you again, so you just stare at him vacuously.#char$$1$$0$0#

#&7$Eren##br#
"I bet you're wondering how I'm supposed to go about drinking a bottle full of seawater, yeah?#br#
 Let me tell you somethin'! This bottle ain't no ordinary bottle! There's some kinda magic on it#br#
 that purifies salt water into the tastiest, most delicious, all-natural drinking water you've ever#br#
 had the pleasure of dipping your tongue into! Why not give it a taste, huh? Huh? HUH?" #M810010s100+30$Eren$821$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Eren waggles the bottle in front of your face, droplets of it splashing your face.#br#You can do nothing but shake your head.#char$$1$$0$0#

#&7$Eren##br#
"Bun got your tongue? Hyuck hyuck, it's just a tiny sip! I don't mind! Ah, whatever!#br#
 You know, you and %p% sure do make a good team! All chummy already and what-not.#br#
 Old Lady Qyubey told us specifically to keep an eye on dear old %p% when she left.#br#
 And that she needed to apologize to him, too! Wonder why, huh? Wonder why?" #M810010s100+30$Eren$824$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Eren starts tugging absent-mindedly on %p%'s ear. %p%, in turn, seems at a loss.#br#
 They turn to you, big, brown eyes beseeching you for help. You decide this has gone on#br#
 long enough and step between them, making it clear that you're both quite busy.#char$$821$$0$0#

#&7$Eren##br#
"What a shame. WHAT a SHAME! And here we were havin' such a nice little chat, to boot!#br#
 Ah, well, if you've gotta go, you've gotta go! I won't get in your way. Nope! Not old Eren.#br#
 Anyways, was a pleasure talkin' to you kids. Stop by whenever! See ya 'round. See ya 'round!" #M810010s100+30$Eren$821$$1$0#|

 Just as you've freed yourself from the overactive mouth of Eren,#br#you spot Omi's familiar hop-step step-hopping its way towards you. #M803010s100+30$Omi$301$$1$0#

#&7$Eren##br#

#&7$Omi##br#
"Eren! Eren, I've been looking all over for you!#br#
 You've got a package from... WHEW... from Atelia... said it was urgent..."#br#
 Omi's a bit out of breath as he hands Eren a carefully-wrapped, brown-paper package. #M803010s100+30$Omi$831$$1$0#

#&7$Eren##br#
"SenSATIONal! Have I been waiting for THIS puppy! Ohoho! You're a real pal,#br#
 Omi! A real pal! Can't thank ya enough! Gotta be shovin' off now, so...#br# TTYL, folks! Don't miss me too much!" Eren clutches the package in his#br#
 tiny little hands and scampers off, his silent Hoppalong companion at his side. #M810010s100+30$Eren$303$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You scratch %p% behind the ears before turning your attention#br#back to Omi and asking how he's been.#char$$821$$0$0#

#&7$Omi##br#
"Oh, you know... same old, same old.
 Fly me here, Omi! Fly me there, Omi!#br#
 Zip zop zap! Never seem to have any time for myself these days...#br# ...which reminds me-!!" Omi's eyes and ears perk up as though he's#br#
 just remembered something incredibly important. #M803010s100+30$Omi$831$$1$0#

#&7$Omi##br#
"I'll bet you didn't know I was an up-and-coming chef, didja? Well, you're in for a treat!#br# 
 I just so happen to have gotten my hands on a recipe that'll blow the peanut gallery away!#br#
 Thing is, I don't have time to #&46$collect the ingredients#. You don't suppose you could#br#
 do a rabbit a favor and help me out, do ya? I'd give you an advance tasting when I'm done!" #M803010s100+30$Omi$821$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Well, it's not like you have much else going on at the moment, and you ARE trying to collect#br#
 stories for Doreen... Ah, what the hay! You respond that you'd be happy to help and ask#br#what it is he needs.#char$$821$$0$0#

#&7$Omi##br#
"What do I need, kid? WHAT do I NEED, kid?! I need #&46$spines#, that's what!#br#
 Yup! Fresh, juicy, delicious #&46$Pincerpod spines#! Five of the suckers.#br#
 Think you can nab 'em for me? There should be Pincerpods all over the bay area. Easy as pie!" #M803010s100+30$Omi$822$$1$0#|
50992|#&7$Omi##br#
"I wouldn't think someone like you'd have problems with those Pincerpods.#br#
 Just give 'em a whack and toss their spines in your sack! Watch out for the#br#
 pointy ends, though. One wrong move and BAM! Right through your eye!" #M803010s100+30$Omi$821$$1$0#|
50993|#&7$Omi##br#
"Well, tickle me pink! That didn't take you too long, did it?#br# Let me take a gander at those spiiiines!#br#
 Mm-hmm! Just look at 'em. Ripe, fresh, and oh-so-sweet! I'll#br# drop these spinal snacks in the pot straightaway!" #M803010s100+30$Omi$821$$1$0#

#&7$Omi##br#
 Omi whips out (you don't dare ask from where) what looks like a steel-plated blender,#br#
 tossing the spines inside. Suddenly, you're treated to the gut-wrenching symphony of#br#
 crackling cartilage, macerating spinal meat, and splattering juices. When the mixture has#br#been thoroughly liquefied, Omi carefully scrapes the paste out into individual jars. #M803010s100+30$Omi$824$$1$0#

#&7$Omi##br#
"Now, let's see... hair follicles of a Rhinosker, dried blubber from a Wingrus, and...!!#br#
 A dollop of fresh, morning dew. Voilà! Oh, I almost forgot the most important ingredient!#br#
 A whole jar of Fellswine lard! Ohoho, that would have been a TRAVESTY!"#br#
 Omi hastily mixes the amalgamation of nauseating ingredients together with the pink paste. #M803010s100+30$Omi$824$$1$0#

#&7$Omi##br#
"What'd I tell ya! Look at that glisten! That gleam! C'mon, give your throat a good ol' wettin'."#br#
 Omi pours some of the chunky concoction into two glasses and hands them to you and %p%,#br#eyes hopeful. #M803010s100+30$Omi$822$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 The two of you simply stare down at the fetid, abnormally-colored goop. The smell makes#br#
 your stomach turn. Omi, however, is looking at you SO proudly that you just couldn't bear#br#to disappoint him. You plug your nose and take a gulp.#char$$826$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 As the pulpy, fleshy medley slides down your throat, you feel your entire body convulse.#br#
 Your vision goes black. From above, you hear the sounds of your beloved friends and relatives.#br#"Oh, our dear %n%. So young! To think they could have given up on this world already."#br#When you come to, you feel as though you've been gored in the stomach by a Rhinosker.#char$$823$$0$0#

#&7$Omi##br#
"Soooo... what's the verdict? Pretty DANG tasty, amirite?#br#
 I can practically see the flavor marbling in the air above your head! Or is that smoke?#br#
 At any rate, look at ol' %p% over there! Fella passed out it was so good!" #M803010s100+30$Omi$821$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You find yourself at a loss as to how to respond.#br#
 Glancing over at %p%, you see them splayed out across the#br#
 dirt, white, frothy bubbles leaking down their chin.#char$$1$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Finally, you decide to tell the truth—that it's an... "acquired taste."#br#
 And that you've "never tasted anything quite like it before."#char$$821$$0$0#

#&7$Omi##br#
"Really? It moved? That's just the answer I was lookin' for!#br#
 This baby'll win me top prize in this year's Modern Dish competition for SURE!" #M803010s100+30$Omi$824$$1$0#|
51000|Seems Omi had asked for help from another Hoppalong named Fate, but she's gone and gotten herself lost somewhere in Crescent Bay!

You'd better go find her before something bad happens... if you're not too late already.|
51001|#&7$Omi##br#
"Hmm... that reminds me, though. You haven't seen, uh... another Hoppalong wandering#br#

"Fate? I don't think I've ever met her before."#br#

#&7$Omi##br#
"Yeaaaah... she's Garth's companion. You'd think with a responsible hunter like Garth,#br#
 she could somehow osmosize a few of his more valuable traits, but that girl?#br#
 She gets lost in the Falcon's Nest. The FALCON'S Nest! She's hopeless!" #M803010s100+30$Omi$831$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You think back to the Falcon's Nest back in Elysium.#br#
 It's very... small. Heck, getting lost in there would take#br#
 some actual TALENT! You're almost impressed.#char$$823$$0$0#

#&7$Omi##br#
"See, I'd asked her if she could find some ingredients for me here in Crescent Bay.#br#
 She's been here a MILLION times. I thought she could handle it! But now?#br#
 It's been three days! Three days!! How could someone get lost in Crescent#br#
 Bay for three days? IT'S NOT EVEN THAT BIG!" #M803010s100+30$Omi$825$$1$0#

#&7$Omi##br#
"I'm pretty sure nothin' TOO bad could have happened to her here, but I can't help but#br#
 be a bit worried. Would sure do my nerves a rest if you could #&46$try and find her for me#!" #M803010s100+30$Omi$822$$1$0#|
51002|#&7$Omi##br#
"Ugh, I really need to give that girl a piece of my mind. She can't keep running off like#br#
 this if she KNOWS she's gonna get lost! Then again, I'm not sure anyone can get through to her..." #M803010s100+30$Omi$826$$1$0#|
51003|#&7$%n%##br#
 As you make your way back to Omi, you notice a Hoppalong you've never met before#br#
 standing restlessly by his side. You open your mouth to report your lackluster findings,#br#but Omi waves you off. #M803010s100+30$Omi$821$$1$0#

#&7$Omi##br#
"Found your way back? I don't know if asking the gearcopter pilot from Cain's Glade#br#

#&7$Lelouch##br#
 You glance over at Lelouch, hoping that maybe he'd reaffirm this with some kind of facial#br#

 giant chunks of his ashen fur. #M805010s100+30$Mholt$827$$1$0#

"Maybe if it was just a small patch! But this? It'd take MONTHS for all of this to grow back. #br#

#&7$Mholt##br#
"Oh-HO! So it IS you, then. Welcome, WELCOME to the glorious Falcons.#br#
 I am Mholt! Companion and pupil to the great Bain, see?#br#
 It is a pleasure to meet you both." #M805010s100+30$Mholt$822$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Taking a glance at the state of the ground, you ask why, exactly,#br#
 Mholt is pulling out all of his own fur.#char$$821$$0$0#

#&7$Mholt##br#
"'Tis an affliction! An affliction most dire. A curse on my paws themselves!#br#
 Nervous or worried, my fingers cannot help but tear into my fur in great,#br#
 greedy handfuls. I've tried all that I can to cure myself of this torment to no avail." #M805010s100+30$Mholt$826$$1$0#

"To make matters all the worse, I'm constantly beset with unfathomable stress,#br#
 which is thinning my coat all the more! What do I do? WHAT do I DO?#br#

"Ah! I've just remembered. My dear friend Marvin instructed me on a way to#br#

 %p% glances up at you imploringly, no doubt wanting to help this poor soul out.#br#
 You have to admit—you've no desire to see a bald Hoppalong amongst the ranks#br#

"Yep! Tons of fun. But hey! Now that the conquering hero has finished up with their stories,#br#
 what say we get back to work, hm? We've got things to do! Places to be!"#br#

#&7$Doreen##br#
"Bah... I suppose you're right. Enough fun for one day, I suppose."#br#
 Doreen reluctantly agrees and turns around to join Angel with his pile of paperwork.#br#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Mholt's eyes glimmer with a bizarre greed for hair the likes of which you've never seen before#br#
 in man or rabbit. He snatches the pelts from your outstretched hands, and before you can#br#utter a single syllable, he's biting into them with the untapped fury and fervor of#br#every being who's ever been subjected to premature hair loss.#char$$823$$0$0#

#&7$Mholt##br#
"It's... so tough... my teeth can... scarcely bite through it..."#br#
 Mholt's mouth overflows with torn scraps of animal fur, now coated in sticky saliva. #M805010s100+30$Mholt$825$$1$0#

#&7$Mholt##br#
"How-... *ahem*... how do I look? Am I already sporting stunning new locks?"#br#
 Mholt fights back tears in his eyes as he lets out a phlegmy cough. #M805010s100+30$Mholt$821$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Unsure how to react after what just transpired, you glance over Mholt's form,#br#
 hoping (for his sake) to see some kind of change. Unfortunately, his fur looks#br#
 just as thin and patchy as it had previously. You and %p% exchange identical#br#
 looks of affliction, your hearts aching for the poor Hoppalong.#char$$1$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 As you gaze into Mholt's eyes, you almost crumble beneath the overwhelming hope and#br#
 desperation, but you know lying would only make things worse. You have to tell him the truth.#char$$821$$0$0#

#&7$Mholt##br#
 As you relate your findings, you see the spark vanish from Mholt's eyes.#br#
Dead inside, he wearily shakes his head, a heavy sigh passing his lips.#br#
 "Another failure... I should have known! A bedeviled derelict such as I does not#br#
 deserve such fortune! Oh, I'm NEVER buying information from that swindler ever again!" #M805010s100+30$Mholt$826$$1$0#|

 It's true, though. As the two Hoppalongs in front of you go back and forth—Eren#br#

 Only one baby otter remains, flailing and thrashing wildly in your hands.#br#
 You can't seem to get it in the sack! Just as you're about be a bit more... "forceful" in#br#

Apparently, though, Agatha doesn't seem to mind if he eats OMI'S food, which gives you an idea. An idea which does, however, involve coming face to face once more with one of Omi's "delicacies"...|
51061|#&7$Louis##br#
"H-... hello, %n%... *hick*..."#br#
 You turn around at the sudden sound of sobbing and spot little Louis#br# making his way towards you, his cheeks, chin, and neck soaked with tears#br#and snot. #M804010s100+30$Louis$827$$1$0#

#&7$Michaela##br#
"Good heavens, child! Not again! What happened?#br#
 Tell your big sister, Michaela, yes? Did Agatha yell at you, hm?#br# Did you fall again and scrape your knee? Shall I kiss it?"#br#

#&7$Michaela##br#
"Dear GOD! You must have gone delirious in your hunger!"#br#
 Michaela's face scrunches up as though she's just taken a bite from a fresh-laid turd.#br#
"Nothing that preposterous monkey makes is even CLOSE to edible."#M807010s100+30$Michaela$831$$0$0#

"I wouldn't get close to that so-called chef with a six-foot pole!#br#
 Time to bid my adieus. Take care of Louis for me, wouldn't you, dear?#br#
 Tralala!" Michaela takes off as fast as her tiny bunny legs can take her. #M807010s100+30$Michaela$303$$0$0#

#&7$Louis##br#
"O-... one day, Agatha caught me... *hic*... sneaking away with some of Omi's cooked#br# chicken, but she-... *hick*... didn't get mad! It was s-so... strange... *sniff*..."#br#
 For just one moment, Louis forgets that he's upset, pondering this conundrum as he stares#br#
 off into space. His thought-process is interrupted, however, by the growling of his stomach. #M804010s100+30$Louis$826$$0$0#

#&7$Louis##br#
"Ohhh... *hic*... I'm sooooo hungrrrryyyy-!"#br#

51063|#&7$%n%##br#
 You shove the soup into Louis's hands as fast as is physically possible.#br#
 Louis almost falls over from the shock, but then begins slurping up the soup#br# in big, hearty gulps! He murmurs in happiness between each mouthful.#br#
 Could... could the soup possibly taste... good?! You can't believe it... #M804010s100+30$Louis$824$$1$0#

#&7$Louis##br#
"Omi's cooking is just amazing! The-... the best thing I've ever tasted!#br#
 Do you guys... *gulp*... want some? It's so, so tasty!"#br# Louis swallows his last gulp before offering you the tureen,#br#
 winning smile plastered across his (tear-and-snot-streaked) face. #M804010s100+30$Louis$821$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You take a step back at the offer, one eyebrow raised in incredulous concern.#br#
 "Amazing?" "Tasty?" These are two words you'd sooner say after sticking your head#br#
 inside the bowl of a portable toilet! But... but... Louis looks SO happy,#br# and he's eating it SO greedily. Could it actually be—dare you think it?—edible?!
 #char$$1$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You bring a spoonful of the soup to your lips. It trembles within the miniature saucer.#br#
 You take the plunge. Instantly, your muscles lock up. Every piece of bodily hair on your#br#person shrivels up and turns to ash. Dreamily, you look up and spy your great-grandparents#br#waving at you from the nearby tree. "%n%! Oh, %n%! It's time for you to join us, dear!"#char$$823$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 A sudden thump from beside you breaks you from your reverie.#br#
 You turn to find %p% sprawled out on the ground, violently twitching.#br#
 Their face has gone a sickly shade of blue, and you wonder, for a second, if they've#br#
 died. Glancing back up, you find Louis still slurping away happily at the soup. #char$$826$$0$0# 

#&7$Louis##br#
"Look at that! It was so amazing that %p% passed out!"#br#
 Louis giggles to himself. At least he's... happy, now?#br#
 "Omi's cooking sure is something else! You want some more, %n%? Huh? Huh?"#br#
 Something else is right! That stuff could take out armies! #M804010s100+30$Louis$2$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Valuing the life of your nearest and dearest friend—yourself—you promptly refuse#br#
 the offer. You add that you're, uh, watching your weight! Yes! And that Louis is#br#welcome to the rest...#char$$807$$0$0#|

"Whazzat? Well, I'll be a rabbit's two-timin' uncle-in-law! If it isn't %n% and %p%!#br# You're lookin'-... actually, you're looking a bit distressed. Something wrong, chilluns?"#br#
 Omi pauses his gearcopter-polishing mid-buff and turns around, clearly concerned.  
   #M803010s100+30$Omi$821$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
   You quickly explain Louis's situation and ask if he could possibly whip up#br#some food for the starving Hoppalong.#char$$821$$0$0#

#&7$Omi##br#
"Not aGAIN! That poor fool. Every day it's something new!#br# The only reason Agatha chose him in the FIRST place was because he#br# ate too much so he was all chubby. Called it his 'fur-fat,' BWAHAHA!#br#
 But I digress. Two days?! That's torture!" Omi nabs the ingredients, shaking his head.
   #M803010s100+30$Omi$824$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You let this thought roll around in your mind a few moments before the most horrifying#br#
 realization dawns on you. Agatha didn't... didn't choose Louis because he'd make#br#
  the perfect emergency food supply if something went horribly wrong in the field,#br#did she? DID SHE?!#char$$823$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 The color drains from your face as a whole slew of gruesome images runs through#br#
 your head. Silently, you reach down and pet %p%'s head. You pet it so hard#br#
 that %p%'s face contorts, and they quickly bat away your hand.#char$$821$$0$0#

 "What's wrong, %n%?" %p% glances up towards you in confusion.#br#
 You tell them it's nothing they need worry themselves with.#pets100+30$$2$$1$0#

"Now, douse with Mothrake pupa juice to taste..." Omi dumps an entire can of foul-smelling#br#
 liquid into his pot. "And... voilà! It's finished! Louis' favorite dish—Meatball Bouillabaisse!"#br#
 Omi hands you a tureen of soup. The smell melts your nose hairs. #M803010s100+30$Omi$824$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You try to look down at the sickly, green sludge, but find that the very film coating#br#
 your eyeballs has gone up in flames. Imagining what this malodorous soup tastes like#br#
 ruptures your stomach wall. In a fit of panic, you grab %p%'s hand and rush back#br#to find #&46$Louis#.#char$$826$$0$0#|
51070|Omi's thinking of turning over a new leaf—by entering the pet food craze! His first order of business comes from Lenora, who's asked him to cook some food for a poor, aging Rhinosker.

51071|#&7$Louis##br#
"Huh?" All of a sudden, Louis's eyes cross as he stares at the bottom of the bowl.#br#
 Tiny fingers fishing around inside, he pulls out a rather soggy-looking note.#br#
"Dear Louis. Tell %n% and %p% to get their rascally behinds over here.#br#
 I have a mighty need!! Thanks, Omi." Louis blinks his big, doe eyes in your direction. #M804010s100+30$Louis$831$$1$0#

"Hmm... looks good. Smells good. Seems enough like a small, wounded animal.#br#
 The only question NOW is if it'll TASTE good to the big brute."#br#

"Wh-... what is... what is THAT?! Oh, god! The smell! M-my eyes are burning!"   #pets100+30$$827$$0$0#

#&7$Omi##br#
 Omi turns around at the sound of retching.#br#
"Ah, perfect. I was just expecting you. You're not still hungry, are you, %p%?#br# Bah! What am I saying? You couldn't eat this anyway!#br#

#&7$Omi##br#
"There's this one Rhinosker that's too old to forage for itself. It can't eat normal food,#br#
 you see? Teeth are worn down or something. That's why Little Miss Lenora asked me to#br#
 cook it some comfort food! Easy on the gums, you know? Like gruel!#br#Or, in this case—creamy otter-haggis grits." #M803010s100+30$Omi$831$$1$0#

#&7$Omi##br#
"Anyways, the food is ready, but there's just one problem—I have no idea if that old#br#

 My reputation as world's greatest Hoppalong pilot and chef dilettante would be ruined!#br#That's why I need you to go deliver it to that ragin', cagin' woolly bully and see if he likes it!" #M803010s100+30$Omi$831$$1$0#|

"What-ho? What's the meaning of all this crazy waving and shaking?#br#I have no time for gratuitous gesticulations! Oh, it's just %n% and %p%."#br#
 Mholt blinks owlishly as the confusion leaves his features.#br#For just a moment, he stops yanking on his fur. #M805010s100+30$Mholt$3$$1$0#

"You must know I really have no time for idle chit-chat! I'm on a most perilous,#br#

"Sure, if we can! We weren't able to help much last time, though..." #pets100+30$$1$$0$0#

#&7$Mholt##br#
"Quite. But let's not linger on the past. You see, I've bought this new miracle hair growth#br#
 recipe from Marvin! He was oh-so-adamant that it would actually work this time.#br#
 But look at this LIST! All these ingredients! For ONE regenerative tonic! It's as if the#br# seas of cruelty have opened up before my very eyes and are slowly crushing me whole!" #M805010s100+30$Mholt$831$$1$0#

51083|#&7$Harris##br#
"Anthony! ANthony!! Your guests have retuuuurned!"#br# Harris barks into his workshop upon your arrival,#br#
 and soon, the illustrious Hoppalong himself steps out from the door.

#&7$Anthony##br#
"Roger that, my good man!#br# I see you two are looking sharp!#br#
 How did your mission fare? Find some new allies?"#br#
Anthony saunters towards you, still chewing on his wheat stalk.   #M814010s100+30$Anthony$4$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Oh, yes, Sgt. Anthony, sir! Like, like, like Silus! He really is as handsome#br# as everybody says! And Michaela? She, uh, well, she is kind of a witch,#br#

"I like to hear that, private! You know, I see you as an optimist.#br#
 You always see the best in people! Use that to your advantage.#br#
 But never let someone take advantage of YOU!"#br#
 Anthony stands at attention and points a furred finger in your direction. #M814010s100+30$Anthony$831$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You admit it was fun getting to know a few of the other Hoppalongs.#br#
 %p% seems to be in a better mood, too! Maybe Anthony was right#br#
 about the whole "Hoppalongs being social creatures" thing.#br#
 At any rate, you owe him your thanks.#char$$821$$0$0#

#&7$Anthony##br#
"Don't mention it, my human-skinned associate. Was just a few suggestions, is all!#br# You needn't thank me. Ah, and it looks like Harris has finished up with his own work.#br#You'll be wanting to speak with him, I assume." With a crisp nod and a click of his heels,#br#
 Anthony struts back into the workshop.

51084|#&7$Mholt##br#
"Would you two be so kind as to grind up those ingredients you brought back?#br#
 It needs to be a fine powder! Like flour. Or ammonium sulphate." Mholt turns#br#
 around upon your approach, in the middle of stirring a thick, strangely-colored liquid. #M805010s100+30$Mholt$602$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You nod, the two of you emptying the contents of your sacks into a giant mortar and#br#
 going at it like frenzied miners. During the meanwhile, Mholt begins adding all sorts of#br#
 ghastly items to his own concoction—everything from Wingrus fins, Fungal Croaker feet,#br#Fellswine innards, and a number of things you fail at recognizing.#char$$823$$0$0#

#&7$Mholt##br#
 Once satisfied with the state of the revolting mixture, Mholt gathers up the#br#
powder you've ground and slowly adds it to the pudding-like mass.#br#"The final ingredient! With this powder, it should be complete." #M805010s100+30$Mholt$824$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You watch as the color of the gelatinous muck changes from russet, to glaucous, to#br#
 chartreuse. After it has rapidly turned seven or eight different colors, it settles on sickly puce.#char$$823$$0$0#

#&7$Mholt##br#
 Mholt stares down at the trembling bowl of slop as though he could light it on fire with#br#
his eyes. Finally, he takes a deep breath and downs the entire container. "Oh, how vile!#br#How repulsive! It's as though ten thousand miniature dung beetles were feasting upon#br#my tongue!" Mholt wipes ferociously at his tongue.#M805010s100+30$Mholt$827$$1$0#

#&7$Mholt##br#
After a few moments of tension, he turns towards you and %p%, arms splayed.#br# "Well? Have my silken locks begun to regrow? You must tell me the truth!"#br#
   #M805010s100+30$Mholt$831$$1$0#

 All of a sudden, %p% lets out a throaty scream.#br#
"Your... your... your FUR! It's... changing color!!"   #pets100+30$$825$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You watch as Mholt's fur, indeed, begins to change color—first from russet, to glaucous, to#br#
 chartreuse, just as its jellified instigator had in the bowl only minutes prior.#br#
 Once cycling through the rainbow of rancid colors, it finally settles on sickly puce.#char$$823$$0$0#

#&7$Mholt##br#
 Mholt's eyes grow wider and wider as he watches his own hands perform a color disco.#br#
"My... my hair! My gorgeous, beautiful, illustrious HAIR! I shall be the laughingstock#br#
 of all Hoppdom! Where is that Marvin? Where is that good-for-nothing, double-crossing,#br# mendacious reprobate! I'm going to KILL him! No, I'm REALLY going to kill him!" #M805010s100+30$Mholt$825$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You and %p% watch Mholt leave, a fuming ball of puce-colored rage.#br#
 Somehow, you have to wonder if his hair troubles will EVER be over...#char$$826$$0$0#|

"Hmm... I'd give you an assignment or two from the league,#br#

 Angel scratches his chin, scrutinizing your environs in thought.

All of a sudden, Doreen emerges from the shadows behind#br#
 Angel like a silent assassin, eyes aglint.
   #M815010s100+30$Doreen$1$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Feeling more and more uncomfortable the longer Doreen keeps staring, you finally ask#br# Angel if there just might happen to be something his companion would like to say.

#&7$Silus##br#

 Whatcha been up to? Whatcha doin'? How's life treatin' ya? Losin' weight?#br# Gainin' weight? Gainin' a sense of propriety? HAHA! I crack myself up sometimes."#br# Eren wipes at a tear forming in his eye.
   #M810010s100+30$Eren$821$$1$0#

 You're not quite sure how to respond—or even if you COULD—to Eren's barrage of questions.#br#
 After a bit of thought, you finally decide to simply say you're fine and continue on#br#
 as normal. Unfortunately, Eren interrupts you just as you open your mouth.#char$$1$$0$0#

#&7$Eren##br#
"I heard that Karen's really, really tied up right now, right? So, like, she asked you to help#br#
 her hunt those Toxroaches? Nobody knows Karen like I do, let me tell ya! You know why?#br#
 Because she can't STAND touching those nasty bugs. But, but, but what I don't understand is#br#

 then runs circles around him, thudding his head against Silus's shoulders. #M810010s100+30$Eren$827$$1$0#

#&7$Silus##br#
 Silus doesn't reply—or move, for that matter. He simply stands as still as a#br#tombstone, letting Eren tug and jerk him this way and that. #M811010s100+30$Silus$1$$0$0#|

"Bet you didn't know Enkidu was once captain of his majesty's knights, didja?#br#
 Ohoho! He was HOT. STUFF. I mean, only one Hoppalong in the whole#br# WORLD gets to call himself that! Such an honor, %p%. Such an honor!"#br#
 Eren curls his paws up into little fists, eyes blazing.#M810010s100+30$Eren$831$$1$0#

"But, but, but then, right? He resigned! Just up and left! Vamoose! Gone!#br#

#&7$Eren##br#
"Others, though..." The glint returns to Eren's eyes. "...think Enkidu couldn't live#br#

 heard the rumors, haven't you? About Enkidu and the king? Ohoho, the debauchery!#br# Like some kind of fangirl's fanfic, right? Who'd believe that, right?!" #M810010s100+30$Eren$824$$1$0#

#&7$Eren##br#
Suddenly, Eren's voice goes dark. "...but what if I told you it was true?"#br#
 He sidles up next to you, eyes narrowing salaciously. #M810010s100+30$Eren$831$$1$0#

#&7$Eren##br#
"I've got the proof, you know... I mean, just think about it! Why else would—"#br#
 Eren stops short in the middle of his sentence as if coming to a sudden realization.#br#
 The entire forest seems to fall silent around you.

#&7$%p%##br#
"Eren? What is it, Eren?"#br# %p% blinks in confusion for a moment, then tugs on Eren's arm.
  
 #pets100+30$$4$$0$0#

Eren snaps out of it with a shake of his head.#br#
 "N-... nothing! Nothing at all! You know what, I should really report#br#
 back to Lelouch! I'll bid you fine people adieu! Tootle-oo! À plus!"#br#

"Perfect. The supplies I needed. A new whetstone, a few bundles of sticks, and..."#br#

"Ah, you must forgive me. I haven't even introduced myself.#br# I am, indeed, Enkidu, as you've now ascertained. I am a mercenary#br#

 Enkidu puts down the package and bows his head in polite salutation. #M813010s100+30$Enkidu$822$$1$0#

 You respond in kind before introducing %p% and yourself.#br#
 You can't help but wonder why he would choose such a life for himself,#br#
 but your lack of nerve keeps you from asking.#char$$822$$0$0#

#&7$Enkidu##br#
"No doubt, you question my motives, child. As do many whom#br#
 cross my path. Let's just say I... had my time. Had my glory.#br#

 A perfectly-timed breeze whistles through the trees as Enkidu finishes. #M813010s100+30$Enkidu$1$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You find all manner of speech stolen from you in the warrior's aura#br#
 exuding from seemingly every pore of Enkidu's person. Once you've#br#
 recovered, you quickly apologize lest you've offended him in any way.#char$$822$$0$0#

#&7$Enkidu##br#
Enkidu responds with a hearty laugh.#br# "Nothing of the sort, child. Nothing of the sort!#br#

"You just wait, Mr. A.N. Onymous! You JUUUUUST wait!#br#
 I'll show you! I'll show everyone! No one gets in the way of a master!"#br#
 Omi practically rips the letter to shreds in his crazed hysteria. #M803010s100+30$Omi$824$$1$0#|
51113|#&7$Marvin##br#
 You arrive with the vials of fresh ram blood to find another Hoppalong#br#
 standing beside Omi. He's dressed neatly, crisply, and his ears are pulled#br#
back in what resembles a comb-over. He gives you a strange look before effectively#br#
 ignoring you, muttering something about "cookware" and "boatloads of dough."#M812010s100+30$Marvin$826$$1$0#

#&7$Omi##br#
"Just you wait... I'll beat you... I'll beat everyone! Nobody can beat Omi, you hear? NOBODY!"#br#
 Omi mutters and twitches while slowly slicing the meat for his cake. #M803010s100+30$Omi$2$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Hey Omi, we've brought the Vinehorn Ram blood back for you!"#pets100+30$$831$$0$0#

#&7$Omi##br#
"Great stuff! With this sanguine treat in my cake, I'll definitely ace the cooking competition!"#br#
 Omi takes the Vinehorn Ram blood and then wheels out the cooking pot, which#br#
 is already bubbling. Seems he's all ready to begin the baking process. #M803010s100+30$Omi$824$$1$0#

#&7$Omi##br#
"Let's see, now... a soupçon of Vinehorn Ram blood, a fillet of Rock Gigant Steak,#br#
 and delicious chunks of Marinated Raptite Scale..." Omi adds a dazzling variety#br#
  of ingredients into the pot and begins stirring the mixture vigorously. #M803010s100+30$Omi$824$$1$0#

#&7$Omi##br#
"Yes! It looks like perfection itself! Oops, I almost forgot to add the Crescent Crystal Shell!"#br# A little while later, steam wafts from the pot.#br#
 And with it, a weird and musty odor reminiscent of old socks.
 #M803010s100+30$Omi$831$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Oh, uh... how... wonderful! Let me just take in the savory fragrance..."#br#
 %p% takes a tiny sniff from the pot and immediately passes out cold.
 #pets100+30$$827$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Seeing Omi in full cooking fervor, you are a little concerned that he may ask you to#br#
 be his 'lab rat' again once the cooking is finished. You decide to leave discreetly#br#
 before the smoke clears...#char$$826$$0$0#|
51120|Your companion has broken Marvin's prized wooden statue. You're not quite sure how something carved out of wood could possibly have been made so shoddily as to break at such a faint touch, but there's not much you can do.

Put yourself on Amber Alert and get over to Cain's Glade so you can repay Marvin ASAP!|
51121|#&7$Marvin##br#
 Just as you make it to safety out of Omi's ear- and eye-shot, you turn around#br#
 to find that richly-dressed Hoppalong from earlier has been following you. #M812010s100+30$Marvin$1$$1$0#

#&7$Marvin##br#
"Oy, you there! You two are %n% and %p%, aren't you?
 "Greetings, yeah? %n%? %p%? I'm Marvin. Know-it-all to end-it-all, see?"#br#
 Marvin slicks back his ears with some kind of thick grease. #M812010s100+30$Marvin$831$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Marvin? MARvin? The names rings a bell... you think?#br#
 You vaguely remember Mholt mentioning that name once or twice...#char$$1$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Oh, hello, Mr. Marvin, sir. It's nice to meet you.#br#
 But, uh... how did you know our names already?"#pets100+30$$822$$0$0#

#&7$Marvin##br#
"Because everything gets back to me, see? Anyway, that's not the point.#br#
 The point is, you're the newest members of the Order of the Falcon."#br#
 Marvin effectively regains control of the conversation. #M812010s100+30$Marvin$831$$1$0#

#&7$Marvin##br#
"So, to extend a welcome to my most esteemed colleagues,#br#
 I've decided to share a little something special with you, see?"#br#
 Marvin procures a small wooden statue from who-knows-where. #M812010s100+30$Marvin$831$$1$0#

#&7$Marvin##br#
"I acquired this beauty not long ago. Not long ago, at all. Flawlessly crafted, it was,#br#
 by a master sculptor! This was very hard to come by, see? A one-in-a-million type thing.#br#
 What do you think, eh? What do you think? Its graceful curves... Its satiny sheen..."#br#
 Marvin rotates the statue carefully in his paws. #M812010s100+30$Marvin$1$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You take a good look as he extends it towards you. It depicts a warrior #br# Hoppalong wielding an axe. It certainly does look exotic and expensive. Like a#br#
 real treasure, almost! But Marvin is holding the statue so tightly, it's hard to#br# get a good glimpse of it...
 #char$$1$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
 %p% looks at the wooden statue of the warrior Hoppalong, their eyes aglow.#br#
 They unconsciously draw closer to Marvin, trying to see it more clearly.#pets100+30$$1$$0$0#

#&7$Marvin##br#
"%p%, it's a true work of art, yeah? Look at the power! That lithe sinew.#br#
 Go on—take it and have a closer look, see? I don't mind. Not at all."#br#
 Marvin turns to %p% slowly.
   #M812010s100+30$Marvin$831$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Really? It moved? %p% reaches out their hand excitedly to take Marvin's warrior Hoppalong.
 #pets100+30$$822$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
 As soon as %p% touches the statue, however, you hear an ominous cracking sound!#br#
 The warrior Hoppalong's head breaks right off as though it's been bitten by a loose seal.#pets100+30$$1$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Huh...? Uh-ohhh!"#br#
 I-it was all so sudden, neither you nor %p% know exactly what happened!
 #pets100+30$$3$$0$0#

#&7$Marvin##br#
"What's the big idea, eh? What's the big idea! You broke my masterpiece!"#br# Marvin glares at %p% angrily, his demeanor having pulled a one-eighty.
  
   #M812010s100+30$Marvin$825$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"O-oh, dear! I... I'm really sorry. I-I didn't mean for it to happen..."#br# %p% is at a loss for words, staring  at the broken hand fragments littering#br#
 the ground.#pets100+30$$827$$0$0#

#&7$Marvin##br#
"Do you have any idea how expensive this statue was?! t would have sold for... for...#br#
 seven—no, eighteen HUNDRED million, see? Eighteen HUNDRED million at auction!#br#
 How're you gonna repay me, huh? How're you gonna repay me?!"#br#
 Marvin glares angrily at %p% while pointing accusingly at the statue. #M812010s100+30$Marvin$825$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"G-gee, Mr. Marvin, sir! I'm sorry, but I-I don't have that kind of money...#br#
 I don't know what to do!" %p% panics, looking up at you helplessly.#br#
 #pets100+30$$827$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You apologize to Marvin, saying you will—of course—repay him for the statue.
 #char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Marvin##br#
"I don't think that you can afford it, see? But, ehhh, you seemed pretty#br#
 sincere about all that just now, so..." Marvin picks up the broken fragments#br#
 of the statue carefully, placing them in his backpack.
   #M812010s100+30$Marvin$825$$1$0#

#&7$Marvin##br#
"I'll tell you what I'm gonna do for ya. There's this thing called #&46$Emerald Amber##br#
 here in the glade, see? It just so happens to be the season for it. Real quality stuff.#br#
 Real quality." Marvin averts his eyes wistfully, as though still mourning his statue. #M812010s100+30$Marvin$826$$1$0#

#&7$Marvin##br#
"If you can help me gather some of that amber, see, it may help#br#
 offset some of those millions you owe me! Whaddya say, huh? Whaddya#br#
 say? Of course, it'll never compare with my beautiful statue, but..."#br#
 Marvin shakes his head morosely from side to side. #M812010s100+30$Marvin$826$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Seems like he's willing to let you off the hook this time.#br#
 You promise Marvin to look for this amber posthaste!#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Marvin##br#
"I can indeed see why Bain Blitzhardt recommended you. You're a real hero, see?#br# A real hero! I'll lend you a pretty nifty #&46$shovel# for the job. You might#br#
 be needing it. Get as much as you can, now, you hear? As much as you can!"#br#
 Marvin eagerly hands you said shovel, sadness seemingly having evaporated.
   #M812010s100+30$Marvin$831$$1$0#|
51122|#&7$Marvin##br#
"My precious statue... my beautiful precious statue! I'll never find another one like it!#br#
 NEVER!!" Marvin watches you out of the corner of his eyes as you take your leave. #M812010s100+30$Marvin$826$$1$0#|
51123|#&7$Karen##br#
 After collecting the Emerald Amber, you head back to find Marvin.#br#
 On the way, however, you just so happen to bump into Karen. #M809010s100+30$Karen$1$$1$0#

#&7$Karen##br#
"Good day to you, %n%, %p%. Looks like YOU'RE in a bit of a hurry, no?#br#
 Where, pray tell, might you be heading?"   #M809010s100+30$Karen$822$$1$0#

#&7$Marvin##br#
 You greet Karen with a smile, and ask how Delphia's been doing.#br#
 Just as you're about to tell her about Marvin and his statue,#br#
 Marvin appears in the distance and hastily dashes over to interrupt you. #M812010s100+30$Marvin$303$$1$0#

#&7$Marvin##br#
Wh-what are you doing here, huh? What're you doing here?"#br#
 Without waiting for a response, Marvin turns to speak to another#br#
Hoppalong behind him. "Hey, your mistress is over there, see?" #M812010s100+30$Marvin$831$$1$0#

#&7$Karen##br#
"Hm? Did something happen to my father? What's wrong?"#br# Karen looks surprised to see the Hoppalong behind Marvin.  
   #M809010s100+30$Karen$831$$0$0#

#&7$Servant##br#
"M-mistress! The master has sent word for you!"#br#
 Taking advantage of Karen's distraction, Marvin#br#
 grabs your arm and drags you a few feet away.#char$$1$$0$0#

#&7$Marvin##br#
"You're back, huh? Did you find it? How did it go?#br# I'm talking about that Emerald Amber, see? Where is it?" #M812010s100+30$Marvin$4$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You give the Emerald Amber to Marvin, hopeful that he'd be#br#happy with the amount you'd collected.#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Marvin##br#
"Great St. Delilah! The riches! Th-there's so much!#br# I'm gonna be rich, see? So rich! This is the best day#br#
 of my life!" Marvin happily takes out a pouch and mumbles#br# to himself as he skips about.
   #M812010s100+30$Marvin$824$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Watching Marvin jump for joy, you realize he's completely forgotten about you and %p%.#br#
 You give into your curiosity and ask if what you'd gathered would be enough to replace#br#the lost statue.#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Marvin##br#
"Enough? Oh. See. Well, this looks to be about a million, see?#br#
 But you're still short. If my calculations are correct, about one point#br#
 seven nine billion short." Marvin immediately reverts back to his#br#state of abject depression at the sound of your voice, eyes clouding. #M812010s100+30$Marvin$826$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Th-that still seems like an awful lot..." %p% looks at Marvin guiltily—a look that Marvin#br#
 returns with unbridled fervor. They gaze at one another with mutual sadness in their#br#
 big, doe eyes.#pets100+30$$826$$0$0#

#&7$Marvin##br#
"But it doesn't matter how much is left, see? What's more important is that#br#
 you're willing to make amends for it, yeah? So, I'll just call on you the next#br#
 time I'm in need of a favor or two, see? You'll... eventually be able to make up#br# for this hole in my life..." Marvin pouts as he slides the Emerald Amber in his backpack.  
   #M812010s100+30$Marvin$826$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You think Marvin is acting a bit odd, but you DID break his prized statue.#br#
 Perhaps it's best just to let it alone. You pat %p%'s head in consolatory sympathy. #char$$801$$0$0#

#&7$Marvin##br#
"Ahem! That's it for now, then. There's something I need to attend to!"#br#
 Upon packing up his stuff, Marvin hurries off without another word. #M812010s100+30$Marvin$303$$1$0#|

   #M809010s100+30$Karen$831$$1$0#

#&7$Karen##br#
"I was wondering, %n%, %p%...#br#

#&7$%p%##br#
"What is that sack for, Karen?"#br#
 %p% stares at the sack in Karen's hand.#pets100+30$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Karen##br#
"It's not but a small, piddly little task. I'm sure you'll have no problem with it. You see,#br# my family wants a #&46$baby Toxroach# sent home, yes? But I'd promised#br#

 with fiddly tasks like this. You need to #&46$catch this Toxroach alive,# you see.#br#
 I think he'd just get annoyed and storm off if he didn't catch one first time..."#br# Karen trails off and looks at you, smiling plaintively...
   #M809010s100+30$Karen$1$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 From Karen's expression, you don't need her to say anymore.#br#
 You see you'll be really helping her out if you could do this for her.#br#
 So you agree to help.#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Karen##br#
"I'm very sorry, you've probably got better things to do...#br# And catching Toxroaches alive requires a bit of finesse. But I'd be so grateful if you could help."#br#
 As Karen is speaking, she fiddles with the bag she's holding as if to test its durability.#br#
  
 #M809010s100+30$Karen$822$$1$0#

#&7$Karen##br#
"Oh, thank you! THANK you! All right, then, dear—I have an appointment with#br# Lelouch, so I must be running along now. Could you take the baby Toxroach#br#
 directly to him as soon as you've caught it? Thank you SO much!" #M809010s100+30$Karen$831$$1$0#|
51132|#&7$Karen##br#
"Don't worry about keeping them when you've caught them. #br# This Poison-Proof Sack has been woven from a special mesh.#br#
 Toxroaches can't rip through it no matter how hard they try."#br#
 Karen sounds very cheerful as she puts the sack in your hands, but you're not quite convinced...
    #M809010s100+30$Karen$831$$1$0#|
51133|#&7$Lelouch##br#
 You do as Karen said and take the captured, baby Toxroach to Lelouch.#br#
 As you approach, however, you're surprised to find a crowd of Hoppalongs#br#you don't recognize surrounding Lelouch and Karen. #M806010s100+30$Lelouch$1$$1$0#

#&7$Lelouch##br#
"Karen."#br#
 Lelouch lightly taps Karen's shoulder to get her attention.
   #M806010s100+30$Lelouch$1$$1$0#

#&7$Karen##br#
 Karen seems pleasantly surprised to see you, immediately moseying#br#
 her way over to you through the milling Hoppalongs.  #M809010s100+30$Karen$301$$1$0#

#&7$Karen##br#
"What PERFECT timing! It gives me a good excuse to escape, ohoho.#br#
 That lot over there have been driving me up the wall! Literally! I've only#br#
 just come down from that nearby tree. At any rate..." She reaches forward to#br#
 take the sack from you, but suddenly hesitates, letting her paw drop. #M809010s100+30$Karen$831$$1$0#

#&7$Karen##br#
"Ah, this is the Toxroach my father wanted, I gather?#br#
 I don't suppose... one of you could help me bring it to him, could you?"#br#
 Karen turns and calls over to the crowd of Hoppalongs, neatly avoiding#br#
 touching the sack with its wriggling Toxroach inside. #M809010s100+30$Karen$831$$1$0#

#&7$Servant##br#
"Right away, Mistress!"#br#
 The Hoppalongs say in unison upon hearing Karen's request.
   #M801010s100+30$Servant$822$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You're a bit bemused by the whole situation with Karen and the crowd of clearly#br#
 deferential Hoppalongs. You turn to %p% and ask why those Hoppalongs are#br#calling Karen "Mistress."#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"You didn't know? Karen is the second daughter in the illustrious#br#
 Hunter family! Naturally, the other Hoppalongs show her respect."#pets100+30$$831$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 %p%'s response doesn't make things any clearer to you.#br#
 You ask %p% why some Hoppalongs have last names—#br#
 like Karen and Eren, or Lelouch—but others... don't?#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Karen##br#
"That's because in the Hoppalong kingdom, only royalty and nobility have last#br#
 names. They're almost like... titles! Everyone else just has first names, yeah?#br#
 Karen overhears your question and hastens to explain. It looks like she's#br#
 already delegated some folks to deal with her newly-obtained Toxroach. #M809010s100+30$Karen$831$$1$0#

#&7$Karen##br#
"Also, the longer the name, the more honorable the family, generally speaking.#br#
 Should they choose to leave the kingdom and go off on their own, however, they give#br#
 up their status—becoming the same as everyone else, as it were. Nevertheless, this isn't#br#something you need trouble yourself with so." #M809010s100+30$Karen$822$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Then Karen is part of the Hoppalong Kingdom nobility? Judging#br#
 from her regal mien, it doesn't surprise you all that much.#br#
 Of course, if SHE'S nobility, then that means Eren is, too...#char$$826$$0$0#|

 the curtsey for so long, actually you wonder if she hasn't fallen asleep. #M808010s100+30$Fate$822$$0$0#

#&7$Lelouch##br#
"The clear dew was destined for yesterday and the cold wind rings the morning bell;#br#
    The rolling hills speak of both joy and sorrow, and frost's eternal dream fills the dell."#br#
 Lelouch nods to Fate before falling silent. As you look back and forth between Fate and#br#
 Lelouch, you can't tell who's more out to lunch. This is getting ridiculous. #M806010s100+30$Lelouch$1$$1$0#

#&7$Fate##br#
"I quite... agree with you... your Majesty..."#br# A hint of what could possibly be happiness graces Fate's features.
   #M808010s100+30$Fate$1$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You don't understand a word of the conversation between Fate and Lelouch.#br#
 You glance over at %p% and catch them quietly laughing at you.#char$$826$$0$0#

#&7$Fate##br#
"Oh, %n%. His Majesty is saying he... really appreciates you...#br# I'm so..." Fate pauses. Pauses so long, in fact, that you—again—wonder if she#br#
 hasn't fallen asleep. "...envious." She turns to show her respect once more.
  
   #M808010s100+30$Fate$822$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"That's right! That's right! His Majesty doesn't usually grace humans with his#br# sage words! As far as I know, you are the first human he's favored since Van#br#
 Pelt! Which is, uh, saying something!" %p% echoes Fate's cheerful sentiment.
  
 #pets100+30$$824$$1$0#

#&7$Fate##br#
"Well, then... I will wander back to my... experiments...#br#
 Thank you..."
 #M808010s100+30$Fate$822$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 After Fate leaves, you steal a quick glance at Lelouch, but#br#
 his gaze once again seems lost somewhere on the far horizon. #M806010s100+30$Lelouch$1$$1$0#|
51145|Head over to the Alluvial Wash|
51150|Delphia asks you to check up on Fate, then see if you can check in on any other Hoppalongs whom may need your help. For just a moment, it occurs to you that you seem to be spending as much time as a Hoppalong gofer as you do training for combat, but they're so cute you can't resist! You're a rabbit grabbit and you're OK with that!

The Hoppalongs have just set out for Cain's Woods. Make your way over there to look for them!|
51151|#&7$%n%##br#
 Just as you're about to make your way out of the crowd,#br#
 Delphia taps you on the shoulder and accosts you.#char$$2$$0$0#

#&7$Delphia##br#
"%n%, since things have already gotten this far, you really should#br#
 take a moment to rest. If not for yourself, look at dear %p%! They look#br#
 about to collapse from fatigue..." Delphia nods towards your companion.
   #M327090$Delphia$822$$1$0#

#&7$Delphia##br#
"I suggest that you go mingle with the Hoppalongs, hm? See what they have to say?#br#
 You might even find something of interest! #&46$Karen# has also been asking#br#
 about you. It seems she has some kind of favor that needs doing..." #M327090$Delphia$821$$1$0#

#&7$Delphia##br#
"Oh, and before I forget—you wouldn't happen to know Fate, would you?#br# That DEAR little Hoppalong always getting herself into strange places#br#
 and situations? Kind of dreamy? Takes forever to say anything?" #M327090$Delphia$4$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Who could forget her? We once helped Omi search for her all over Crescent Bay.#br#
 Then? We found out she'd gotten lost she'd wound up in Cain's Glade!#br#
 I won't be forgetting HER for a while." %p% shakes their head.#pets100+30$%p%$4$$0$0#

#&7$Delphia##br#
"Let me be frank—excepting her terrible sense of direction, Fate is no scatterbrain!#br#
 In fact, she positively excels when it comes to science! Oftentimes, she secretly#br#
 takes on commissions to craft items. She has a simply extraordinary sense of purpose." #M327090$Delphia$821$$1$0#

#&7$Delphia##br#
"I believe she's looking for someone to help her run some tests for her experiments.#br#
 I'll admit, though—some of those experiments DO worry me. She might be bright, but,#br#
 well, you've met her. If only for the sake of my faint heart, could you perhaps check in on#br#her and make sure she's all right?" #M327090$Delphia$4$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Fate, huh? This might be a good opportunity to make more friends!#br#
 You cheerfully accede to Delphia's request.#char$$821$$0$0#

#&7$Delphia##br#
"Wonderful! I knew that you would agree, %n%! Now, since you'll already be out there,#br# would you mind checking on the other Hoppalongs, as well? They're always getting into#br#
 some sort of trouble!" Delphia flashes you a saccharine smile, and suddenly, this whole#br#
 conversation starts to make sense...

 You spot Karen as soon as you get to Cain's Woods.#br#
 She smiles at you as you leave the gearcopter.#br#
 It looks like she's been waiting there a while now. #M809010s100+30$Karen$1$$1$0#|
51160|Karen is helping to get food ready for the celebration of both her birthday and Eren's, but she is still missing some fresh ingredients.

Karen would like you to head off to Cain's Woods so you can catch and bring back a live Banebill Platypus.|
51161|#&7$Karen##br#
"Good day %n% and %p%! How LOVELY to see you.#br#
 You are really looking quite the heroes these days.#br#
 Things must be working out well for you, I gather?" #M809010s100+30$Karen$822$$1$0#

"Hey, there, Karen! Good to see you, too. I've been running#br#
 about all over the place with %n% lately! Practically feel like#br#
 I'm gonna pass out, ahaha... ha..." %p%'s laughter takes on a slightly manic tone.#br#
 #pets100+30$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Karen##br#
"Ohoho, indeed! Well, great work—both of you. I truly mean it.#br#
 By the way, I'm going to be holding a banquet very soon!#br#
 I was wondering if you could perchance free up some of your busy schedule?#br#
 Everyone would love it if you would join us." #M809010s100+30$Karen$4$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Oh, wowie! A banquet? For real?! I don't even remember#br#
 the last time I've been to one of those! I miss those days..."#br#
 %p%'s cry of joyful surprise clouds with reflective nostalgia.
 #pets100+30$$4$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 This is the first time you've received an invitation to a banquet since you joined the#br#
 order. It makes you wonder why the Hoppalongs are even holding a banquet to begin#br#
 with. It must be something special. You ask Karen what the big occasion is.#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Karen##br#
"Ohoho, I thought you would never ask! Actually, Eren and I have our birthday#br#
 coming up! Eren often forgets about it completely, so I wanted to put together#br#
 a little something for the occasion. A grand gala! Like nothing you've ever seen!"
   #M809010s100+30$Karen$831$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Your birthday?! Oh, boy! Oh, boy! That's the BEST reason to celebrate.#br#
 There's no WAY we'd miss that, right, %n%? Right?!"
  
 #pets100+30$$831$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You completely agree, adding that you'll bring a present, as well.#char$$806$$0$0#

#&7$Karen##br#
"That is SO sweet of you. Thank you. Thank you so much! Actually, there IS one more#br#
 thing you could do for me, if you don't mind my asking. I'm still missing some#br#
 #&46$Banebill Platypus# meat for one of the principal dishes in the banquet.#br#
 Is there any chance you two could pick some up for me?" #M809010s100+30$Karen$4$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"We'd be happy to do anything for the birthday girl! Just leave it to us!#br#
 Good luck with all the preparations, yeah? Oh, man! I'm SO looking#br#
 forward to this!"
 #pets100+30$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Karen##br#
"Perfect. In that case, please take these #&46$Fishing Nets# with you.#br#
 I want to offer my guests the chance to eat only the freshest of dishes at the banquet.#br#
 So please—can you make sure you capture the Banebill Platypus #&46$alive#?"#br#
 Karen hands the neatly folded and freshly washed fishing nets to you. #M809010s100+30$Karen$4$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You agree to Karen's request and take the nets. The more you know about#br#
 her, the more you can see that she and Delphia make the perfect companions.#br#
 They're exactly alike! Well, except for the ears. And the tail. But there's no#br#
 need to nit-pick!#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Karen##br#
"Oh, how perfect. I'll soon be sending an invitation to Lelouch.#br# Do you think you could take the live Banebill Platypus directly to him?"
   #M809010s100+30$Karen$831$$1$0#|
51162|#&7$Karen##br#
"Well, let me see... I think we're almost done preparing for the banquet.#br#
 However, I want one last check through to see if anything can be improved on.#br#
 I hope everyone has a great time at the banquet." Karen's face softens with a smile,#br#
 her eyes alight with the hopes and dreams of her birthday celebration. #M809010s100+30$Karen$4$$1$0#|
51163|#&7$Karen##br#
 From afar you can see Karen and Lelouch conversing,#br#
 but on approaching you are not surprised to find#br#
 that you can barely make head or tail of their discussion.#br#
 Can this still even be called a conversation? #M809010s100+30$Karen$831$$1$0#

#&7$Karen##br#
"Well I never, %n% and %p%, you got here so quickly!#br#
 You don't waste time, do you.#br#
 I really appreciate your help with this."#br#
 Karen gives a slight bow of grateful acknowledgment. #M809010s100+30$Karen$822$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Think nothing of it.#br#
 Although the Banebill Platypus is a fiendishly tricky creature to catch,#br#
 by working together with %n% as a team,#br#
 we managed it no problemo!"#pets100+30$$4$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 At this point, you see Karen is painting on some pretty pieces of cloth.#br#
 She is tracing out the words "Happy Birthday Eren" in beautiful handwriting.#br#
 That's odd, it's her birthday too, so why doesn't she add her name too?#br#
 You ask her.#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Karen##br#
"Oh, that's just because this banquet is for Eren especially.#br#
 I want everybody to focus on him, and celebrate his birthday rather than mine.#br#
 That's why I haven't added my name."#br#
 Karen smiles as she explains. #M809010s100+30$Karen$831$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Oh, but won't you feel neglected?#br#
 That's such a pity! It's your birthday too!"#br#
 %p% looks sorry about this.#pets100+30$$831$$0$0#

#&7$Karen##br#
"Oh, precious! You're an absolute dear! But it's totally fine, really!#br#
 At any rate, a number of other banquets are being held for me,#br#
 It's just that... Eren didn't get invited to them, unfortunately. Some of my#br#
 friends, well... they don't really understand Eren's sense of humor, you see." #M809010s100+30$Karen$831$$1$0#

#&7$Karen##br#
"But if nobody's there to celebrate with Eren on his birthday, it would be a real shame.#br#
 So I've been wanting to throw a birthday banquet for Eren for ages, and finally I can.#br#
 Could you keep this a secret? Don't tell Eren, please."#br#
 Karen is a little embarrassed to have to say this. #M809010s100+30$Karen$831$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Just as you and %p% immediately agree not to breathe a word of it,#br#
 the Banebill Platypus you've already handed over to Karen jumps out of the tank#br#
 and makes a crafty escape.#M115010s30+50$$301$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Argh! Oh, no!#br#
 We have to hurry up and catch... hey, are you alright?"#br#
 %p% suddenly stops talking on seeing Karen's face.#pets100+30$$302$$0$0#

#&7$Karen##br#
"What... you want to escape? #br#
 I have never had prey I've already caught dare escape my grasp.#br#
 Stop struggling this instant!"#br#
 Karen's gracious manner instantly changes, and there's an excited gleam in her eyes. #M809010s100+30$Karen$2111$$1$0#

#&7$Karen##br#
 How peculiar. Karen always appeared so gentle and kind, but she's suddenly gone berserk.#br#
 She utters strident battle cries and runs around like a perfect barbarian,#br#
 seizing the Banebill Platypus and throwing it back in its tank.#br#
 You and %p% stand back and watch, amazed.#M115010s30+50$$301$$0$0# #M809010s100+30$Karen$2111$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"My word, you, you got it...#br#
 Karen, you're absolutely amazing..."#br#
 %p% stares open-mouthed at Karen now she's calmed down.#pets100+30$$1$$0$0#

#&7$Karen##br#
"Ah... yes... I was hoping you didn't see that. I'm very sorry.#br#
 It appears I just snapped...#br#
 Sometimes when things get really tense, I get so excited I just can't seem to control myself."#br#
 Karen rubs at her face, going bright red with embarrassment. #M809010s100+30$Karen$4$$1$0#

#&7$Karen##br#
"Just forget all about it, please.#br#
 So, uh, I will soon let you know about when and where the banquet will take place.#br#
 Thanks for your assistance! I'm sorry for all the hassle."#br#
 Karen bows deeply to express her gratitude. #M809010s100+30$Karen$822$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 After you bid Karen farewell, you and %p% watch her go with a lingering uneasiness.#br#
 You now know two secrets that you can't tell anyone else.#br#
 You can't help but wonder if Delphia too has a secret violent side...
 #char$$823$$0$0#|
51170|Lelouch is just as undecipherable as always, to you at least, but your companion deduces that Fate has gotten herself lost again.

 Lelouch stares off into the distance with misty eyes.#br#
 He seems to be pondering something and clearing his mind of thoughts at the same time.#br#

 Lelouch reseals the package. #M806010s100+30$Lelouch$1$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You tell Lelouch the message Enkidu asked you to pass on#br#
 and mention that you know Enkidu was once Lelouch's teacher.#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Lelouch##br#
"Ah really?... I see...#br#
 Master Enkidu is the most outstanding Hoppalong I have ever known.#br#

"But even a powerful Hoppalong like Master Enkidu#br#
 has hurdles he cannot surmount.#br#
 That is why he abandoned all of his beloved students,#br#

#&7$Lelouch##br#
"He thought if he gave up everything he could go on without any more worries.#br#
 He didn't realize that the suffering would be hidden deep within himself.#br#

 I really want to help my master, but I fear... no one can help him with this..."#M806010s100+30$Lelouch$831$$1$0#

"Oh, poor guy..."#br#

#&7$%n%##br#
 After learning about Enkidu's past, you really want to know exactly what made#br#
 him willing to give up everything. So you ask Lelouch some questions of your own.#br#

 He no longer seems able to take in anything on the outside. #char$$4$$0$0#

 I never knew that Enkidu had such a tragic past..."#pets100+30$$826$$1$0#

 #char$$2$$0$0#|
51174|#&7$%n%##br#
 You and %p% can't find any trace of Fate in Cain's Woods.#br#
 Just as you're about to give up the search,#br#
 you suddenly feel as though you're being watched.#br#
 You turn to find Enkidu laughing at you, in a lazy nonchalant manner. #M813010s100+30$Enkidu$1$$1$0#

#&7$Enkidu##br#
"Oh, it's %n% and %p%!#br#
 Fancy running into you two here.#br#
 What a coincidence. Or was it... Did Lelouch ask you to come here and find me?" #M813010s100+30$Enkidu$4$$1$0#

"Oh, you must be psychic or something!#br# It was, indeed, Lelouch, Mr. Enkidu, sir!#br#
 It's been a long time!"#br#
 %p% becomes very excited upon seeing Enkidu.#pets100+30$$822$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 After you greet Enkidu,#br#
 you and %p% tell him what Lelouch said.#br#
 You also mention that you gathered Fate was lost somewhere around here,#br#
 but you've looked everywhere and can't find any sign of her.#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Enkidu##br#
 After Enkidu hears what you have to say, he seems lost deep in thought for a long moment...#br#
"...'One we've missed'... Those are the exact words? Well, maybe that's a bit strong...#br#
 Lelouch always does take things a bit too far.#br#
 You don't need to go find Fate. These words were meant for me." #M813010s100+30$Enkidu$831$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Eh?! But, but Mr. Enkidu, you don't look like you're lost..."#pets100+30$$831$$0$0#

#&7$Enkidu##br#
"If I could, I would explain it to you as well.#br#
 However... there are still many things that even I can't see through..."#br#
 Enkidu looks off into the distance, lost in thought—or maybe memories.
   #M813010s100+30$Enkidu$831$$1$0#

#&7$Enkidu##br#
"I will, however, do my best to answer questions about anything else you might#br#
 wish to know. How about it? Have you run into any difficulties recently?#br# I can help you solve just about any problem. Except those related to money. I'm no#br#
 expert there." Enkidu pats his fallen pack and laughs.
   #M813010s100+30$Enkidu$831$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Enkidu seems to know Lelouch very well. Curious, you work up the#br#
 nerve to ask him outright what their relationship is exactly.#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Enkidu##br#
"Ah, yes... I was once Lelouch's teacher.#br# I taught him everything—from the martial arts to the arts of calligraphy. #br#
 Sadly, I'm even responsible for teaching him the poetry he now hides behind. You see...#br#
 I was once a teacher who was famous for the number of outstanding students he had..."   
 #M813010s100+30$Enkidu$1$$1$0#

#&7$Enkidu##br#
"But that was in the past. In those days, if I had seen anybody as promising as#br#
 %p%, I would have certainly taken them on as my student. But nowadays...#br#
 I am not qualified to lead anyone—no matter who they might be..."#br# Enkidu pats %p%'s head with a bittersweet smile.
   #M813010s100+30$Enkidu$831$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
 Touched by Enkidu's complex and frustrated emotions,#br#
 you and %p% are at a complete loss for words.#br#
 All three of you are quiet for a time.#pets100+30$$1$$0$0#

#&7$Enkidu##br#
"Anyway, I'm not the one who is important here.#br#
 All that is just a long-distant memory now.#br#
 You youngsters can make a bright future for yourselves."#br#
 Enkidu removes his hand from %p%'s head and pulls out a #&46$package#. #M813010s100+30$Enkidu$831$$1$0#

#&7$Enkidu##br#
"#&46$Please, take this to Lelouch#.#br#
 Keep making him talk to people so that he doesn't forget how?#br#
 That's all for now. Perhaps in the future, if our paths ever cross,
 we can discuss matters further." #M813010s100+30$Enkidu$831$$1$0#

51180|Lenora had asked Fate to create a non-lethal Dragomon Repellent. 

Fate never got a chance to test it. Now she wants you to go to Cain's Woods and test the Water Bomb on the Pincer Drones there. Into the woods with ye!|
51181|#&7$Lelouch##br#
 Lelouch marches off. Just as you begin to follow, Fate interrupts. 
  #M806010s100+30$Lelouch$301$$1$0#

#&7$Fate##br#
"Can you ... do me ... a favor ...?"
 Fate motions you closer. Though she tries to hide it, #br#
 you can tell that something is bothering her. #M808010s100+30$Fate$831$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Fate is holding a round, pearl-like object. #br#
 There is a thin wire protruding from the top...#br# ... it's got to be some kind of experimental tool, right?#br#
 You tell Fate that you'd be happy to help.#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Fate, what is that in your hand?" #br#
 %p%'s eyes widen as they approach the object, itching for a closer look.
 #pets100+30$$831$$0$0#

#&7$Fate##br#
"Lenora's assignment ... was for me to create ... a bomb ... that would drive off ... the animals ...#br#
 It's called a ...#&46$ Water Bomb# ... though it's ... non-lethal ...#br#
 it's best ... if you ... don't get too close ..."#br#
 Fate notices %p% shaking the ball and snatches it back. #M808010s100+30$Fate$831$$1$0#

#&7$Fate##br#
"It's complete ... but ... I haven't ... tested it yet ...#br#
 Can you ... help me ... test it ...?"#br#
 Fate hands the Water Bomb to you, keeping it out of %p%'s reach. #M808010s100+30$Fate$1$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You carefully take the #&46$Water Bomb# and ask for a good location to test it. #char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Fate##br#
"The #&46$Pincer Drones# ... around here ... would make for ... excellent ... test subjects ...#br#
 Watch out for ... the liquid ... that shoots out ..."#M808010s100+30$Fate$831$$1$0#|
51182|#&7$Fate##br#
"The Water Bomb ... isn't ... lethal ...

 Fate gives %p% a nervous look. #M808010s100+30$Fate$1$$1$0#|
51183|#&7$Omi##br#
 The test successful, you set out to find Fate,#br#
 whom you find buried in a book. Beside her is a grinning Omi. #M803010s100+30$Omi$1$$1$0#

#&7$Omi##br#
"I came here for some scrap metal to repair my gearcopter. #br#
 When I ran into Fate here. She scared me half to death."
  #M803010s100+30$Omi$821$$1$0#

#&7$Omi##br#
"Fate is in your hands. I'll be back for her after I get my materials. I'll be back!",#br#
 Omi shouts over his shoulder as he runs off.#br#
 He's gone before he even finishes his sentence. 
      #M803010s100+30$Omi$303$$1$0#

#&7$Fate##br#
 You turn and look at Fate. Oblivious of Omi's departure,#br#
 She is still immersed in her research notes.
  #M808010s100+30$Fate$1$$1$0#

#&7$Fate##br#
"Next time ... I'll try ... a gas powered ... version..." #br#
 She mumbles while scribbling some notes. #M808010s100+30$Fate$2$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Fate! The Water Bomb worked like a charm...#br#
 One whiff and the Pincer Drones bolted for the hills!"#pets100+30$$821$$0$0#

#&7$Fate##br#
"This ... smell ... I think it's... on you as well... oh no...#br#
 #M808010s100+30$Fate$831$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Oh don't worry, we haven't touched the liquid.#br#
 The Water Bomb works perfectly! You should have seen how the Pincer Drones fled!#br#
 It might work a little too well though. If you're saying you can smell it on us..."
 #pets100+30$$831$$0$0#

#&7$Fate##br#
"I ... miscalculated ...
 The effects ... should not have ... been so widespread ...#br#
 I'll need to ... look into that ... recheck the ingredients ..."#br#
 Fate scribbles into her notebook.  #M808010s100+30$Fate$824$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 "Ingredients ...", she repeats in a detached voice.#br#
 You wonder what ingredient could possibly make you smell this bad. #br#
 More importantly, your nostrils are screaming for your attention. You implore Fate#br#
 for a solution to rid of yourself of this stink before your nasal cavities shut down.#char$$826$$0$0#

#&7$Fate##br#
"I ... have no idea ...#br#
 Maybe ... Omi will ... know..."#br#
 Fate gives you an apologetic shrug. #M808010s100+30$Fate$1$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Why would Omi know that?"#br#
 %p% takes a cautious sniff of his own paw,#br#
 but quickly turns his head away, coughing and retching in disgust.#pets100+30$$826$$0$0#

#&7$Fate##br#
"The solution ... in the Water Bomb ... it was ... mixed by ...  Omi.#br#
 He says ... that it's a ... highly nutritious ... healthy beverage ...#br#
 I thought ... that it would ... be very effective ... at driving off wild beasts ..." explains Fate. #M808010s100+30$Fate $831$$1$0# 

#&7$%n%##br#
 "Omi made a drink that smells like this?#br#
 You and %p% share disgusted looks.#br#
 Fate, however, seems unperturbed by this.#br#
 In fact she looks faintly amused that you would find this idea so shocking. #char$$823$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Wait so... ...if Fate is familiar with this drink....#br#
 ... and she's drunk it before, #br#
 how come she doesn't reek like we do?"#br#
 %p% asks intrigued.#pets100+30$$831$$0$0#

#&7$Fate##br#
"%p%... so you're ... interested in ... my experiments ...#br#
 Well let me give you a comprehensive explanation.#br# After Omi bought in this liquid that he refers to as a "drink", I brought a sample to my lab.#br#
 Once I had on protective clothing, I ran some tests on it in a sealed room."
   #M808010s100+30$Fate$831$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You notice that when Fate is talking about her experiments, it's as if a fog has been lifted. #br#
 Her usual dazed look of confusion replaced by the excited face of a scholar.#br#
 Her speech is now eloquent and fluid, with words flowing forth without hesitation. #br# It's like she's a completely different person.#char$$823$$0$0#

#&7$Fate##br#
"Once I had confirmed that the sample was potable and, more importantly, not toxic#br#
 I experimented on what effects it would have on one's taste buds. However, like most of Omi's, er,#br#
 concoctions, this test yielded less than positive results. Who knew that taste buds could cry? #br#
 However, I found that it behaved similarly to other beast repellents we had tested in the past..."#M808010s100+30$Fate$831$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Ohh... wow, ok, umm, yeah, I get it ...#br#
 I uhh, thanks for the explanation, it was uhh... great!"#br#
 %p% hurriedly stammers, hoping to cut off Fate's explanation.#pets100+30$$1$$0$0#

#&7$Fate##br#
"Wait! Wait! I'm not done! I'm just getting to the good part. This is where#br# it gets REALLY exciting. So I said before that the compounds behaved in#br#
 a similar manner, BUT! The one in Omi's 'drink' produced results more#br#
 remarkable than anything of that caliber! So then, I-... I-..." Fate gushes on and on.  
   #M808010s100+30$Fate$4$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 At this point you're pretty sure the smell is making your nose bleed. #br#
 You stare hopelessly at %p%, trapped in Fate's long-winded explanation of her experiment.#br#
 You silently pray for Omi to hurry back. #char$$826$$0$0#|
51184|Use the Water Bomb to repel Pincer Drones|
51190|To rid yourselves of the Water Bomb's unholy stench, you and your companion seek a solution from Omi. It was his foul recipe that got you smelling like fermented Rhinosker dung, so he'd better help you out. Unfortunately, the antidote recipe he's come up with looks none too inviting... 

Omi wants you to go to Cain's Woods to collect Toxroach Venom Sacs and Pincer Drone Saliva. Could these cure you of your malodorous condition? Only one way to find out.|
51191|#&7$Omi##br#
 Two hours of Fate's incessant talking is finally broken by the return of Omi.#br#
 As though planned, he strides through the door just as Fate finishes her final #br#
 words about her experiment. She immediately buries herself back in her notes. #M803010s100+30$Omi$301$$1$0#

#&7$Omi##br#
"Terribly sorry! Thank you for looking after Fate here-"#br# He stops abruptly and sniffs the air, and a broad smile spreads across his face.#br#
  "Ohhhhhh! So you lucky devils have tried my Salmond Juice!?#br# I brewed it myself from salad, almonds, and other delicious tidbits! How did you like it?"
"Hey!   
     #M803010s100+30$Omi$4$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Em... actually ... well ... we didn't drink it...#br#
 We used the Water Bomb, made by Fate here, and she had apparently put it in the bomb.#br#
 Which is why we smell like this..."#br#
 %p% ends lamely, holding back his laughter after hearing the name of the drink. #pets100+30$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Omi##br#
"Huh? A bomb? What bomb?#br# What on earth would a bomb have to do with my lovely Salmond Juice?#br#
 Is there something with my sense of smell? Come here and let me have a good sniff!"#br#
 Omi leans in with his nostrils bared, vigorously sucking in the odors.
   #M803010s100+30$Omi$831$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 As you see tears start to stream down Omi's face, #br#
 You laugh and explain that Fate has used his prized creation as a Dragomon repellent bomb.#br#
 Omi is not at all happy with this news.#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Omi##br#
"Aghh! For shame! Fate, this was a real culinary delight, a masterwork! To think#br# you've gone and wasted it all on a Dragomon repellent... you have no grounding#br#
 in the finer points of cuisine. It just won't do! I'll need to teach you." #br#
 Omi is so upset he's hopping around on one foot, his ears twitching indignantly.
   #M803010s100+30$Omi$825$$1$0#

#&7$Fate##br#
 Fate doesn't seem to be listening to Omi. She's got her face buried in her notes,#br#
 and seems to be working out some sort of equation. #M808010s100+30$Fate$2$$1$0#

#&7$Omi##br#
 This spells trouble! Nothing upsets Omi more than being ignored. #br#
 Realizing that you have mere seconds to dispel a disaster on par with the Hindenberg, #br#
 you quietly nudge %p% desperately hoping that he might come up with a#br#
 way to diffuse Omi's anger. #M803010s100+30$Omi$825$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Yes, so... Omi! You're saying you've tasted the Salmond Juice too, right?#br#
 Do you have any, uh, recommendations for a palate cleanser to help us with the, erm...#br#
 aftereffects?" %p% tactfully attempts to keep a straight face, but is having trouble#br#
 holding back his laughter.#pets100+30$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Omi##br#
"Actually no. I've never tried my Salmond Juice! I've... well, how should I put this?#br#
 You see, I would have a natural bias towards the gastronomic wonders that I create. So#br# I only allow those around me to sample and taste my food—it's the only fair way, really,#br#
 to get an honest assessment," explains Omi as %p% nearly explodes stifling their laughter.  
   #M803010s100+30$Omi$831$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Trying to steer the discussion back to the issue, you ask Omi about getting rid of the stench. #br#
 Frowning, no longer from anger but concentration, Omi ponders your question. 
  #char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Omi##br#
"Well... the smell should disappear on its own after a while,#br#
 but I can see how that may be a bit of a bother for you both to wait that long...#br# Hold on, let me figure this out... say I put... no... maybe a hint of... what about...#br#
 Omi, deep in concentration, begins transcribing his ideas onto a piece of paper.
   #M803010s100+30$Omi$1$$1$0#

#&7$Omi##br#
"These are the ingredients I'm going to need if you want to be freed from this smell.#br#
 It's a recipe that I discovered only a few days ago actually. Works wonders with eliminating smells.#br#
 Why with just a few sprinkles, you could eat a durian on a train with no problems!#br#
 I'm sure this will work to mask the smell of Salmond Juice, no problem." #M803010s100+30$Omi$831$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You gratefully accept the paper from Omi. Looking at the listed#br#
 ingredients sends a chill down your spine. %p%'s eyes widen in fear#br#
 and alarm as they, too, read the list. Surely, Omi has given you the wrong#br#
 recipe! You ask if this is a recipe for some horrifying poison.#char$$823$$0$0#

#&7$Omi##br#
"Poison? What? No this isn't a recipe for a poison. What makes you say that?#br#
 Let's see here... #&46$Toxroach Venom Sac#... #&46$Pincer Drone Saliva#...#br#
 ...yup. This all looks right.
 Unlucky for you, I seem to have run out of both.#br# Next time I'll be sure to stock more.  #M803010s100+30$Omi$831$$1$0#

#&7$Omi##br#
"Well I need to be at Marvin's place. He's got some custom tools prepared for me.#br#
 Once you've got what you need, come find me there." #M803010s100+30$Omi$831$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Unsure, you look into Omi's eyes, searching for a hint of trickery, when suddenly #br#
 a Pincer Drone wanders in range of your Salmond scent and begins to cry. That's the last straw.#br#
 You realize there's no time for dilly dallying. You smell terrible, and whatever Omi's #br#
 cure does it couldn't possibly be worse than this. So you'd better get a move on...|
51192|#&7$Omi##br#
"Salmond Juice entry 3. The juice tastes fine but its aroma is a bit... strong.#br#
 Goes to show just how easy it is to forget about the smell when you're only thinking of #br#
 making things taste delicious... Another reminder about the importance of an objective opinion."#br#
 Omi updates his cooking diary. #M803010s100+30$Omi$4$$1$0#|
51193|#&7$Marvin##br#
"This here is for you. Please. Confirm it's all there."#br#
 A broad smile on his face, Marvin hands over a large pouch to Omi. #M812010s100+30$Marvin$4$$1$0#

#&7$Omi##br#
 Omi opens the pouch to check the contents.#br#
"One...two... and there's three...#br# Yup, everything seems to be in order. 
 And here is the agreed upon payment.#br# Thanks very much." #M803010s100+30$Omi$831$$0$0#

#&7$Marvin##br#
"No, thank you for the business.  I eagerly await your return." #br#
 Marvin collects the money and bows deeply. #M812010s100+30$Marvin$4$$1$0#

#&7$Omi##br#
"Well, I have time before %n% arrives,
 time to update the old cooking diary."#br#
 Omi pulls out a thick, weathered book from his front pocket.#br#
 He starts scribbling away without looking in your direction. #M803010s100+30$Omi$4$$0$0#

#&7$Omi##br#
"Salmond Juice entry 3. The juice tastes fine but its aroma is a bit... strong.#br#

 Omi updates his cooking diary. #M803010s100+30$Omi$4$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You give Omi the requested ingredients. Who'd have thought that even after#br#
 all this time, the odor would still be clinging to your bodies?
 #char$$826$$1$0#

#&7$Omi##br#
"Perfect, you got me everything I need.#br#
 Now wait a few minutes. I'll be right back with your solution."#br#
 Omi takes the ingredients and begins working on his recipe.  #M803010s100+30$Omi$4$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You and %p% watch in stunned silence as Omi begins preparing his recipe. #br#
 Not a single instrument scattered about the environs seems fit for food preparation.#br#
 It's all too clear now why Fate handled Omi's Salmond Juice not as a drink but as a test sample. #char$$823$$1$0#

#&7$Omi##br#
"All done! Well, what we waiting for?#br# Now—quickly! Quickly! While it's still fresh.#br#
 This should do the trick." Omi ladles the brown,#br#
 muddy concoction into a container and pushes it towards you. 
   #M803010s100+30$Omi$831$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"I-I have to EAT this...?"#br#
 %p% looks at the gloop and faints at the mere thought.#pets100+30$$401$$1$0#

#&7$Omi##br#
"Huh? What happened to %p%?#br# That's a curious reaction. Well, %n%,#br#
 you take this. %p% looks like they're going#br# to need a little help. So I'll feed 'em."
     #M803010s100+30$Omi$831$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You tremulously accept the brown glop from Omi.#br#
 Though hesitant, the wail of another passing Dragomon affected by your stench convinces you to #br#
 swallow it in one gulp. Your mouth and brain are seized by a sudden shock.#br#
 Everything goes black. #char$$802$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You hear the voices of %p% and Omi faintly piercing the fog of your mind.#br#
 "Let me... go... I-I... no...  don't... wanna..."#br#
 "Shh shhh... there, there. Just swallow this... there you go..."#br# You try to concentrate, but your mind is too tired, and you fade out again. 
 #char$$1$$1$0#

#&7$Omi##br#
"Good news! My formula worked perfectly.#br#
 The smell of Salmond Juice has been eliminated.
 Your problems have finally been solved!" #M803010s100+30$Omi$831$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You awake to Omi's words. #br#
 You are secretly thankful that you didn't go through all that for nothing. #br#
 You see %p% lying nearby muttering to himself, seemingly still in shock.#char$$1$$1$0#

#&7$Omi##br#
"Now though it wasn't my fault,#br#
 I'm feeling slightly responsible for the trouble my Salmond juice caused,#br#

 You bid him farewell and go off to find %p%,#br#
 quietly hoping that you never have to live up to your promise.|

 Real nice... I should be able to turn a handsome profit with these."   #M812010s100+30$Marvin$824$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Erm, so... Marvin... about that debt..."#br#
 %p% brings up timidly, still staring at the Fireflies behind Marvin.#pets100+30$$831$$0$0#

#&7$Marvin##br#
"Right, right, the debt!#br#
 So six bags of Fireflies. We agreed, one million per bag so that makes six million.#br#
 I'm not going to cheat you. I am a professional after all." #M812010s100+30$Marvin$831$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Yeah sure... great..."#br#
 %p% responds absent-mindedly, still captivated by the Fireflies.#pets100+30$$1$$0$0#

#&7$Marvin##br#
"Well, it seems like the Fireflies have gotten their grip on %p%.#br#
 Say, how about becoming the first customer of my Firefly business?#br#
 Fifty-percent off is my offer for friends, see?" #M812010s100+30$Marvin$831$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"No, I couldn't possibly! Repaying my debt is my highest priority right now,#br#
 I shouldn't be making any unnecessary purchases,#br#
 especially not something so extravagant as fire... flies..."#br#
  %p% manages to tear away his gaze and looks at you sadly. #pets100+30$$831$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You smile back and assure %p% that you can  #br#
 go back to the Cain's Woods to see Fireflies, if he so desires.#br#
 %p% is overjoyed and nods with shining eyes.#br#
 Marvin, on the other hand is not at all happy with the situation.#char$$831$$1$0#

#&7$Marvin##br#
"Hey now! Whaddya saying things like that for? You trying to ruin my sales?#br#
 I'm going to hold you two accountable if people don't buy my Fireflies,#br#
 and you'll be much deeper into debt with me!" #M812010s100+30$Marvin$831$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You hastily bid farewell to a furious Marvin and decide that it's#br#
 a good time to leave. Suddenly, it hits you that you still don't know#br#
 about Marvin's companion. Curious, you turn to ask...
 #char$$4$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 However Marvin appears to be engrossed in contemplating the next steps for his Firefly venture. #br#
 He isn't even aware that some of the Fireflies are escaping.#br#
 As Marvin looks completely absorbed in his business ideas,#br#
 you don't think it would be appropriate to bother him at the moment. #M812010s100+30$Marvin$1$$0$0#|

51211|#&7$Angel##br#
"I see what you want me to do.
 Alrighty then.#br# Especially seeing that it's a request from the Order of the Falcon,#br#
 I'll try to get into contact with the Alchemic Order for you!"#br#
 Angel hesitates for a while but finally agrees to help. #M308060$Angel$826$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You are relieved to hear that Angel is willing to help,#br#
 and thank him on behalf of Agatha and Atelia.#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Angel##br#
"Wait... Wait! Hold on!
 There's one condition!"#br#
 Angel hurriedly interrupts you. #M308060$Angel$821$$1$0#

#&7$Angel##br#
"It's going to take some time to contact the Alchemic Order.#br#
 Takes 'em a while to decipher the information I send.#br#
 So while I'm waiting for their response, you mind doing me a favor?" #M308060$Angel$4$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Agatha's already warned you that Angel sometimes may need some help with things, #br#
 so you're not surprised that Angel's asking for a favor.#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Angel##br#
"Look here! These stacks and stacks of assignments! So many assignments! #br#
 My board can't fit them all! I'm drowning here!" #br#
 Angel, clearly agitated, stabs a pudgy finger at his bulletin board. #M308060$Angel$825$55$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Looks like Angel is desperate to#&46$ free up some space on his overflowing bulletin board#.#br#
 As he's agreed to help you out as well, it seems like a fair enough trade. #char$$806$$0$0#

 You've got assignments to start, so you're not sure you'll have any time to hang#br#
 about storytelling... You steal a quick glance at Angel, hoping for some indication#br#of how to proceed.#char$$826$$0$0#
  

#&7$Angel##br#
 Angel, towering behind Doreen,
 simply gives you a nod. %p% #M308060$Angel$821$$1$0#

 Now that you have approval from Angel,#br#
 you promise to tell Doreen all the stories that she wants to hear.#char$$821$$0$0#

"Great! Knew I could count on you!#br#
 Well, I'll look forward to hearing all about it when you get back! Til then it's back to the grind..." #M815010s100+30$Doreen$824$$1$0#

#&7$Angel##br#
"I'll get to work contacting the Alchemic Order, yeah? Go ahead and help the little girl#br# out if you would. Those assignments can wait, after all." Even with the overwhelming#br#

#&7$Michaela##br#

#&7$Michaela##br#

 depressed before turning back into the Wicked Hoppalong of the West. #M807010s100+30$Michaela$827$$1$0#

"Well, here goes attempt number 367... It has to work this time! It just HAS to!"#br#

51223|#&7$Michaela##br#
"Hmph... It's not HORrible. At least, not as much as that pigswill you dredged#br#

 You hand over the Lovers' Bloom to Michaela.#char$$821$$0$0#

"So, this is... the Lovers' Bloom..." #br# Michaela's gaze softens as she trails off, staring at the flowers.
 #M807010s100+30$Michaela$1$$1$0#

#&7$Michaela##br#
 Slowly, as though waking from a dream, she returns to her old self.#br#
"Well done! You have done the bare minimum to impress me and thus earned a#br#
 single grain of my gratitude.  I must leave now as I've things to do. Tralala!"#br#
 Michaela briskly walks away, Lovers' Bloom in hand. #M807010s100+30$Michaela$831$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"If she wants those flowers, it's GOTTA mean she likes someone... right?#br#

 %p% stares intently in the direction of Michaela's departure.#pets100+30$$4$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You are, indeed, burning with curiosity about the identity of Michaela's crush,#br#
 and readily agree to follow Michaela... VERY quietly...#char$$806$$0$0#

#&7$Lelouch##br#
 You see Michaela walking stiff-limbed towards Lelouch.#br#
 Red-faced and staring at her feet, she finally works up the courage to speak. #M806010s100+30$Lelouch$1$$1$0#

#&7$Michaela##br#
"Le... Lelouch, this is... the Lovers' Bloom.#br# Let's eat it together, so that we can... we can live happily#br# ever after forever and ever and ever!" Michaela gushes out#br#
 the last sentence and thrusts the flowers in Lelouch's face.
   #M807010s100+30$Michaela$831$$0$0#

#&7$Lelouch##br#
 Once his eyes manage to focus onto the sudden intrusion,#br#
 Lelouch quickly plucks the flower from Michaela's hands.  #M806010s100+30$Lelouch$1$$1$0#

#&7$Michaela##br#
 Michaela gasps at Lelouch's unhesitant gesture.#br#
 Blushing, she looks up at Lelouch with glittering eyes,#br#
 waiting for him to choose a petal for her. #M807010s100+30$Michaela$1$$0$0#

#&7$Eren##br#
"Lelouch! Karen's cooked up a giant feast! All the food! So much food! You're invited!#br# She even said so! Come chow down with us!" You suddenly hear Eren's shout#br#
 from nearby, and turn around to see him and Silus running your way.   #M810010s100+30$Eren$301$$0$0#

#&7$Lelouch##br#
 Lelouch turns to greet Eren and Silus.#br#
"May the pure fragrance linger."#br#
 Lelouch hands over the flower to Eren and Silus. #M810010s100+30$Eren$1$$0$0#

#&7$Eren##br#
"Huh? What's all this? Some kinda flower? What is it, huh? What's it mean?#br# What am I suppose to do with this? Huh? Huh? Huh?" Eren stares at the flower,#br#
 blinking rapidly. #M810010s100+30$Eren$2$$0$0#

#&7$Silus##br#
 Silus says nothing and simply stares at Lelouch.#br#
 You notice Silus's ears twitch as though receiving some sort of signal.#br#
 He then nods and proceeds to eat a few petals of the flower. #M811010s100+30$Silus$1$$0$0#

#&7$Michaela##br#
 Michaela, noticing too late what's happening, reaches out a hand to stop him.#br#
 You hear her start to cry out. "N-no-!!" #M807010s100+30$Michaela$825$$1$0#

#&7$Eren##br#
"Huh? What're you doin', Silus? Flowers? You don't eat flowers! What's goin' on?#br# Is that what you're supposed to do? Did Lelouch say something to you?#br# Is this some kinda special flower? Did I miss something?" Eren's gaze bounces#br#
 back and forth between Silus and Lelouch as he attempts to ascertain the situation.
   #M810010s100+30$Eren$2$$1$0#

#&7$Silus##br#
 Silus hands over the flower to Eren, points at it, then says simply—"Eat."
#M811010s100+30$Silus$831$$0$0#

#&7$Eren##br#
"Eat it? Why? Can't say I really want to, I mean... it's a flower! But since you have, I#br#
 might as well. So anyway, what IS this flower? Will it give me diarrhea?#br# Will I be able to stretch like rubber? Huh? Huh?" Eren never stops talking and#br#
 asking questions as he gobbles up the rest of the petals.
   #M810010s100+30$Eren$2$$1$0#

#&7$Eren##br#
 Once done, Eren checks himself and Silus to see if anything has changed.#br#
 There seems, however, to have been absolutely no effect. "Hey, look! I'm all right!#br#
How about that! You really shouldn't go around eating random flowers, though,#br# y'know? I mean, like... think of the consequences! You could... get sick... or even die!"
     #M810010s100+30$Eren$824$$1$0#

#&7$Eren##br#
"Hey, wait! I'm not here to eat flowers! I'm supposed to be inviting people to the party!#br# %n%, %p%, and Michaela! You guys are invited too, y'know! Everyone's welcome!#br#
 Anyway we've got to go, quick! Karen'll get mad, and boooy, you don't wanna#br#
 make my sister mad!" Eren grabs Silus's hand and rushes back towards Karen.
   #M810010s100+30$Eren$301$$1$0#

#&7$Michaela##br#
 Lelouch follows after them, leaving behind a dazed (and silent) Michaela.
   #M807010s100+30$Michaela$1$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You and %p% hurry over to Michaela, ready to comfort her.#br#
 As you get closer, though, you see that she's talking to herself.#char$$821$$0$0#

#&7$Michaela##br#
"Sure, this might be my 367th failure... BUT I'M NOT GIVING UP!#br#
 I WILL make Lelouch love me one day!" Michaela punches the air,#br#
 her ears bouncing up energetically. #M807010s100+30$Michaela$1$$1$0#

#&7$Michaela##br#
"You think that I'm crazy? What's that look you're giving me?#br# Forget it. Don't say anything! I don't care.#br#
 I have a party to attend. Goodbye."#br#
 Michaela leaves to chase after Lelouch.

51240|Louis has angered Agatha, and thinks he ought to get her a gift as an apology. A well-intentioned idea, sure, but what possessed him to think Omi's food is a good gift? While you can't really imagine this helping matters, at least it shows that Louis's heart is working properly, if not his taste buds.

Your assignment this time is to go collect some Shockondor Legs for Omi to cook. Sounds like it'll be a Shockondorror Stew!|
51241|#&7$Marvin##br#
"All right all right, I got work to do. Money doesn't make itself, see?"#br#
 Marvin waves over his shoulder as he runs off, newly obtained goods in tow. #M812010s100+30$Marvin$303$$1$0#

#&7$Louis##br#
 As you watch Marvin leave, you notice a sniveling Louis staring at you with tearful eyes. #M804010s100+30$Louis$1$$1$0#

#&7$Louis##br#
"Sniff... %p%, what should I do...?#br#
 Agatha is angry with me again..."#br#
 Louis grabs %p% and sobs into their chest. #M804010s100+30$Louis$827$$1$0#

#&7$Louis##br#
"She's been mad at me before... but this time it's different...#br#
 She... she went off on a quest.... without me...#br#
 Do you think she's leaving me? Is... is she coming back? Boohoohoo..."#br#
 Louis cries even harder. #M804010s100+30$Louis$827$$1$0#

"Hey, hey... I'm SURE Agatha will be back.#br#
 Just sincerely apologize to her, and she'll DEFinitely forgive you."#br#

#&7$Louis##br#
"But this time... she's really really mad.#br#
 She's been angry at me before, but still always took me on quests.#br#
 I don't know if a simple apology is going to cut it this time."#br#
 Louis dejectedly continues to sob. There's a small puddle of tears growing at his feet. #M804010s100+30$Louis$826$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Well how about a gift then... an apology gift?#br#
 I'm sure she'll forgive you, if you give her something that you treasure."#br#
 %p% tries again to soothe the miserable Louis.#pets100+30$$1$$0$0#

#&7$Louis##br#
"Something I treasure?"#br#
 Louis stops sobbing and looks up at %p%, a bit puzzled. 
"Do you mean Omi's cooking?"#br#
 Thinking of food seems to cheer Louis up a bit. #M804010s100+30$Louis$1$$1$0#

#&7$Louis##br#
"That's a good idea. I'll get Agatha some of Omi's food and she'll forgive me!"#br#
 Louis turns and looks at you.#br#
"You'll help me right? I just need you to get me some #&46$Shockondor legs from the Sporefall Forest#,#br#
 then #&46$give them to Omi to cook.# Please help me? #M804010s100+30$Louis$822$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You're not sure if Agatha's going to enjoy Omi's food,#br#
 but you don't have the heart to turn down the pitiful, sniveling Louis.#br#
 You and %p% both agree to help.#char$$806$$0$0#|

"Th... this is my favorite food. I got it made, just ff... for you!#br#

 Louis practices his apology to Agatha. #M804010s100+30$Louis$826$$1$0#|
51243|#&7$Silus##br#
 On your way to bring the food back to Louis,#br#
 Silus suddenly appears and stops you.#br# Saying nothing, he points into the distance. #M811010s100+30$Silus$831$$1$0#

#&7$Louis##br#
 You follow Silus' finger wondering what he wants to show you,#br#
 and see Louis and Agatha walking towards each other. #M804010s100+30$Louis$301$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You hand over the freshly cooked food to Louis.#br#
 Louis meekly brings the food over to Agatha. #M804010s100+30$Louis$1$$1$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"What... Ack!#br# What in the... cough cough...!"#br#
 Agatha staggers back, eyelids fluttering.#br#
 She waves the food away, unable to handle its smell. #M320090$Agatha$823$$0$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"Phew... Louis! What the heck is this?"#br#
 Agatha, now recovered, shouts angrily at Louis. #M320090$Agatha$503$$0$0#

#&7$Louis##br#
 Frightened, Louis looks at Agatha, his eyes already beginning to tear up.#br#
"Thats... that's Omi's Pungent Drumstick. A new recipe he came up with. It's my favorite!#br#
 I had him cook that for you specially as an apology from me...#br#
 so that you'd forgive me... please don't be angry with me!"#M804010s100+30$Louis$827$$1$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"What? Forgive you? What are you talking about?"#br#
 Agatha is taken aback. She seems completely bewildered by Louis' words. #M320090$Agatha$1$$0$0#

#&7$Louis##br#
"You... you're not mad at me? But you didn't take me on your quest!#br#
 I thought you were... you were abandoning me!" Booohooohoo..."#br#
 Louis bursts into tears again. #M804010s100+30$Louis$825$$1$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"Wait! Stop! Stop that! I have never even once thought of abandoning you.#br#
 And why on earth would I be angry with you? Who told you that?" #M320090$Agatha$1$$0$0#

#&7$Louis##br#
"Be... because you didn't take me on your quest...#br# I th...thought I had made you mad..."#br#
 Louis wipes his tears and whimpers. #M804010s100+30$Louis$826$$1$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"What? Silly Louis. Did you forget that you're injured from the last quest?#br#
 I didn't take you along because you need to rest and heal up!#br#
 Gah! I didn't think you'd be this paranoid!" #M320090$Agatha$4$$0$0#

#&7$Louis##br#
"I... I thought you didn't like me anymore...#br#
 I'm so sorry... you're so nice to me.... boo hoo hoo..."#br#
 Louis begins to cry tears of relief. #M804010s100+30$Louis$827$$1$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"I said STOP it! Stop crying, or I really WILL abandon you!"#br# Seeing that her words are having no effect, Agatha grabs the smelly#br# 
 drumsticks and rams them into Louis's mouth.
   #M320090$Agatha$821$$0$0#

#&7$Louis##br#
"Blurgh!! Mmph! De-... delicious..."#br# Louis wipes his sleeve across his eyes as he begins eating the drumsticks.
   #M804010s100+30$Louis$826$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Wow. Crying and eating at the same time. He really IS something..."#br# %p% stares at Louis in awe.
 #pets100+30$$1$$0$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"Omi's foods are starting to smell more and more 'powerful' with every new dish.#br#
 I don't think there's anyone other than Louis that thinks Omi's cooking is edible."#br#
 Agatha rolls her eyes and turns to face you,#br#
 while flapping her arms in an attempt to rid herself of the drumsticks' smell. #M320090$Agatha$4$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You and %p% both nod in agreement. #char$$806$$0$0#|
51244|#&7$Omi##br#
"%n% and %p%? Ohoho! What can I do you for, huh? How can I help ya?"#br#
 Omi stops polishing the gearcopter and turns to greet you. #M803010s100+30$Omi$1$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You hand over the Shockondor Legs, and explain Louis' situation—as#br#
 well as how he wants Omi to cook an apology gift. #M803010s100+30$Omi$1$$1$0#

#&7$Omi##br#
"Haha! Of course, I'll help!" Omi proudly thumps his chest.#br#
 "With this new recipe, there's no WAY Agatha will stay mad at Louis.#br#
This is a SPECIAL treat!" #M803010s100+30$Omi$822$$1$0#

#&7$Omi##br#
 Omi takes out his pots and utensils and sets to work,#br#
 looking just like a professional chef. In just a few moments, the food is ready. #M803010s100+30$Omi$824$$1$0#

#&7$Omi##br#
"Well, here you go. My newest signature dish—'Pungent Drumsticks!'#br#
 All I do is marinate these Shockondor Legs in my special sauce,#br#
 before frying them up with ample amounts of forest chilies.
 Agatha's gonna love it for sure!!#br# She'll have to forgive Louis!" #M803010s100+30$Omi$4$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Even though you're quite a distance from Omi, the scent of the food is so strong#br#
 that it alone is enough to make your eyes water.#br#
 %p%, hiding behind your back for cover, refuses to get even one step closer. 
 #pets100+30$$1$$0$0#

#&7$Omi##br#
"Alright! All packed up and ready to go!"#br# Omi ladles the drumsticks into a large lunch box,#br#
 but it's not enough to keep the smells from escaping.
   #M803010s100+30$Omi$2$$1$0#

#&7$Omi##br#
"Now remember! I cooked these for Agatha and Louis!#br#
 So don't you go eating any of it before you deliver it to them!"#br#
 Omi waves his ladle at you, sending gobbets of Shockondor flying about in all directions. #M803010s100+30$Omi$831$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You simply nod, not daring yourself to speak in case you reflexively inhale,#br#
 and leave to bring #&46$the food back to Louis#.#br#
 You know that no matter how hungry you ever got,#br#
 you'd never have the courage to willingly try Omi's "food".|
51250|Silus is preparing a special birthday gift for Eren and needs your help! 

He needs you to go back into the Sporefall Forest and nab him a Shockondor Egg!|
51251|#&7$Silus##br#
 His problems solved, Louis leaves together with Agatha.#br#
 You turn to leave as well, but are gripped by a cold, uneasy#br#feeling that sucks the very life out of your pores. #M811010s100+30$Silus$1$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Hey! Hey, uh, %n%? I think Silus has something to talk to you about..."#br#
 %p% whispers, tugging at your clothes.#pets100+30$$822$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You turn to see Silus, your soul starting to drip down to your feet as he#br#
 stares silently into your eyes.#char$$2$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 The silence hangs heavy in the air, no one saying a word.#br#
 You begin to break out in a cold sweat. Realizing that Silus#br#
 won't break the silence, you decide to ask him what he wants.#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Silus##br#
"Present."#br#
 Silus utters one word and continues to stare at you. #M811010s100+30$Silus$831$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
 You don't understand Silus's cryptic message. Just as you#br#
 open your mouth to ask for more details, though, %p% pokes you.#br#
"It's almost Eren's birthday!"#pets100+30$$1$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Of course! If it's Eren's birthday, then surely Silus must want to#br#
 give him a gift! You ask Silus if he needs your help in picking out a#br#
 present for the Hoppalong motormouth.#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Silus##br#
 Silus shakes his head and says merely one word—"Eggs."
#M811010s100+30$Silus$831$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 This answer puzzles you. You ask Silus if Eren, erm, enjoys eating eggs?#br#
 And if, perhaps, a basketful of eggs or an omelet would make for a suitable gift.
 #char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Silus##br#
 Silus shakes his head again and says simply—"Forest."
#M811010s100+30$Silus$1$$1$0#

"Oh! Oh! I get it! You want to get Eren a #&46$Shockondor Egg##br#
 so that Eren can raise a Shockondor, right? Right?" %p% raises their hand#br#
 in the air like a small child in kindergarten.
 #pets100+30$$831$$0$0#

#&7$Silus##br#
 Seems that %p% has guessed correctly. Silus nods slowly,#br#
 smiling in that not-quite-smile that tells you he's appreciative. #M811010s100+30$Silus$1$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
 Flattered, %p% blushes. In an attempt to hide their embarrassment,#br#
 they turn to you. "S-so... %n%, can we help Silus? Huh? Can we?"
#pets100+30$$822$$0$0#

#&7$Silus##br#
 You nod to say that it won't be a problem. You'd be glad to help!#br#
 As you're leaving, Silus points to a nearby location—"Meet."
#M811010s100+30$Silus$831$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"So, you want us to meet there, right? No problem! Let's go, %n%!"  
 #pets100+30$$821$$0$0#|
51252|#&7$Silus##br#
 As you turn to leave, Silus gives you a pleading stare.#br#
 Seems like he really... REALLY wants to get Eren that Shockondor Egg. #M811010s100+30$Silus$1$$1$0#|
51253|#&7$%n%##br#
 You arrive at the promised meeting point and find Silus talking with Eren.#br#
 Eren soon notices you—AND the large egg you're carrying.
   #M811010s100+30$Silus$1$$1$0#

#&7$Eren##br#
"Wooooo! Well, I'll be! Where'd you get such a huge egg, %n%? Huh? I didn't know#br# Silus was so into eggs! Especially big mammajamma ones like that! How come you never#br#
 told me you liked eggs, huh? I tell you everything! Are you keeping secrets? I thought we#br#
 were closer than that! Don't you trust me? Don't you? Huh? Huh? Siluuuuuus!!"#br#  
           #M810010s100+30$Eren$823$$1$0#

#&7$Silus##br#
 Silus says nothing. He just shakes his head,#br#
 takes the egg from you, then hands it to Eren.#br#
"Present."#M811010s100+30$Silus$1$$0$0#

#&7$Eren##br#
"OHHHH riiiight! My birthday! This is my birthday present! I get it. Well, gee.#br#
 I was just thinking that I really wanted to get my hands on some delicious eggs, and here#br#
 you come along with the perfect gift. You know me too well! You really are the BEST,#br#
 Silus!" Eren hugs the egg with a delighted giggle, all the while looking at Silus adoringly. #M810010s100+30$Eren$822$$1$0#

#&7$Eren##br#
"Man, what kind of egg is this, anyway? It's so BIG! I mean, really!#br#
 It looks like you could feed an entire family with this thing! What should I#br# do with it? Shall we have huevos rancheros? Ohoho, I LOVE huevos rancheros..."#br#
 Eren gently caresses the egg while imagining different egg dishes. #M810010s100+30$Eren$824$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Seeing that Eren has mistaken Silus's intentions for the gift—and is looking to cook the#br#
 egg—you prepare to tell Eren what the egg is actually for. Just then, however, you#br#
 feel a tug as %p% pulls you back. They motion you to look over at Silus.
 #char$$2$$0$0#

#&7$Silus##br#
 Silus is patiently listening to Eren, seemingly unbothered by him rambling on#br#
 and on. You see the hint of a smile playing across his usually expressionless face. #M811010s100+30$Silus$1$$1$0#

#&7$Silus##br#
 Noticing you looking at him, Silus looks at the egg, then back at you,#br#
 then gives you a gentle nod to convey his appreciation.
   #M811010s100+30$Silus$1$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You smile and dismiss it with a wave of your hand, then quietly depart with %p%,#br#
 wanting to give the two Hoppalongs space to celebrate Eren's birthday properly.

#&7$Eren##br#
"Here's the deal. Karen's birthday is coming soon, but I haven't managed to find a present. #br#
 I can't think of ANYthing. I even asked Silus, but he's just as clueless as I am! #br#
 You know Karen, right? What do you think she wants? Can you think of anything she might like?" #br#
 You can tell from the increased fervor of his flailing that he's rather desperate. #M810010s100+30$Eren$827$$1$0#

 Karen bows to you both and leaves with the baby Moomba. #M809010s100+30$Karen$822$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Looking down at the pet accessories, you decide that you may as well leave #br#
 them for Karen. That way, if Eren asks you about the gift, you won't have a  #br#
 handful of pet supplies to explain. That could be... more than a little awkward...#char$$826$$0$0#|

"Oh, how I'd LOVE to have a little pet of my own..."#br#
 Doreen sighs wistfully to herself, ears drooping. #M815010s100+30$Doreen$826$$1$0#

#&7$Angel##br#
"What? A pet? You want a PET? Sorry, hon, but the answer is a big, fat NO.#br# We can't have a Dragomon in this place! Especially not one as fierce as a Bobceratops!#br#
 It'll bother the clients and make a huge mess of everything! Not to mention give me#br# a headache the size of Pelt's libido!"

#&7$Doreen##br#
"Oh, humph! You big party pooper. If I can't have a pet, I suppose I'll just... you know...#br# carry on as usual—lonely and overworked... Nobody cares about me anyway!"#br#
 Doreen makes a big show of throwing herself down on the ground, into the nearby#br#
 wall, and—in general just—acting like her world is coming to an end.
  
   #M815010s100+30$Doreen$825$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 It seems Doreen has heard of Marvin's new shop—you can't imagine how such an#br#
 outrageous idea would have entered her mind otherwise. Really? A Bobceratops?!#char$$810$$0$0#

#&7$Angel##br#
"Heeeey, %n%... you wouldn't, you know, happen to have just a little free time
 your hands, would you? I mean, it's not DIRE, but it's, well, kinda dire. This pet#br#
 thing just won't leave her head! I need to make her forget it, which means I need, uh...#br#
 you to go get more stories for her. Yeah... sorry." Angel looks physically pained.

"Also, it's rather perplexing, but I DO believe that Michaela is harboring some#br#

"I don't want a gift from a LOVE RIVAL!"#br# Michaela spits out the words with venom and tightly crosses her arms.

 towards Karen for that matter!#char$$823$$0$0#

"Lelouch likes Karen more than me! I can tell! Just call it feminine intuition.#br#
 Anyway, there's no way I'm going to be accepting any offering of good will#br#
 from my love rival!" Michaela turns her head away with a flippant sigh. #M807010s100+30$Michaela$831$$1$0#

 Though you're pretty sure this situation is all in Michaela's head—and#br#

 several "dressings" she'd prepared earlier. #M807010s100+30$Michaela$831$$1$0#

 Seeing the strange packaging on these products, you surmise that they're from Omi,#br#

 You manage to find the Marsh Crocoturtle egg and are returning it to Mholt#br#
 when, on the way back, you run into Fate, who appears lost yet again. #M808010s100+30$Fate$1$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Fate, what are you doing here all by yourself? Are you lost again?"#br#
 %p% approaches nervously, afraid Fate might get lost somewhere else.#pets100+30$$831$$0$0#

#&7$Fate##br#
"I didn't... get lost..."#br#
 Fate replies angrily, her cheeks puffed out. #M808010s100+30$Fate$825$$1$0#

#&7$Mholt##br#
"Fate! Didn't I tell you to wait for me?#br# Good gracious, child! Whatever are you doing here?"#br#
 Mholt asks, gasping for air.

"%p% and %n% are here..."#M808010s100+30$Fate$1$$1$0#

#&7$Mholt##br#
 Mholt turns his attention to you,#br#
 but his eyes are immediately drawn to the Marsh Crocoturtle egg.#br#
in your hands. "Oh! The egg! How utterly marvelous! Quick, Quick!#br# Put it in this bag!"
   #M805010s100+30$Mholt$4$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You put the egg in Mholt's bag while subtly#br#
 comparing the egg's height to Mholt's.#char$$806$$0$0#

#&7$Mholt##br#
O blessed day! My hair is saved! SAVED! Now, I just have to#br# crack it open and mix it with the other ingredients... hmm?"#br#
 Just as Mholt is about to crack the egg, it moves slightly, and then the top#br#
 suddenly breaks open!
   #M805010s100+30$Mholt$827$$1$0#

#&7$Baby Marsh Crocoturtle##br#
"Whaaaa!" A baby Marsh Crocoturtle pops out of the egg!#br#
 This sudden turn of events takes you completely by surprise.#br#
 Who would have guessed that the egg was fertilized?!? #M013011s25+50$Baby Marsh Crocoturtle$52$$0$0#

#&7$Mholt##br#
"Wh-what? What is... my egg?! My precious, precious EGG!!#br# Seeing his precious hair remedy ingredient so suddenly hatch leaves Mholt devastated.#br# You and %p% look at each other in dismay, unsure of what to do.
  
   #M805010s100+30$Mholt$825$$1$0#

#&7$Baby Marsh Crocoturtle##br#
"Whaaaa... whaaa!"#br#
 The creature stretches its tiny legs#br#
 and slowly crawls towards Mholt,#br#
 nuzzling its still-moist little head against Mholt's leg. #M013011s25+50$Baby Marsh Crocoturtle$501$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Embarrassed, you look at Mholt and the baby Marsh Crocoturtle,#br#
 then hesitantly ask Mholt if he would like you to bring back another egg.#char$$826$$0$0#

#&7$Mholt##br#
"Oh..." Mholt's gaze bounces between you and the baby Crocoturtle.#br#
 "On second though... no. Seeing this darling miracle of life, the last thing I#br#
want to do is hatch another one!" Mholt hangs his head, dejected, and gently#br#
 strokes the Baby Crocoturtle's somewhat slimy scales. #M805010s100+30$Mholt$826$$1$0#

#&7$Mholt##br#
"I'll let an animal specialist take care of him."#br#
 Mholt tenderly cradles the little creature.#br#
"I guess I'll need to find a new hair-growth remedy..."#br#
 Mholt forces a bitter smile, but he seems much more relaxed than before. #M805010s100+30$Mholt$831$$1$0#|

"Oh, the HORROR! I don't want Enkidu to know I'm BALD!#br#
 At this rate, I'll be the butt of every bald Hoppalong joke ever created...#br# I despite you, Eren! I deSPISE you!!" Mholt suddenly springs to his feet#br#
 and starts howling. #M805010s100+30$Mholt$302$$1$0#

#&7$Eren##br#
"Tsk, all this incessant weeping over a few silly hairs! Even Karen doesn't start#br#
 bawling at the drop of hat... Although—admittedly—you don't see her bare#br#
 head when the hat drops, BWAHAHA! Am I right, Silus? Am I right?!"#br#   #M810010s100+30$Eren$831$$1$0#

#&7$Silus##br#
 Silus looks at you and %p%, then greets the both of you with a nod.#br#
 When Eren simply continues laughing at his own joke, Silus tugs on his#br#wrist to get him to turn around. #M811010s100+30$Silus$1$$0$0#

#&7$Eren##br#
"Hahaha, I knew that's what Silus would be thinking. We really are two of a kind!#br# Like two peas in a pod! Two hops in a long! Hey, whoa! Is that %n% and %p%?#br#
 Where have you two been? What's the hap-hap? What's the word, hummingbird?#br# Hadn't thought I'd be seeing you again so soon! What can the great Eren do for you today?
       #M810010s100+30$Eren$4$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You ask Eren what's gotten into Mholt. Hearing this, Eren rolls his eyes and#br#
 starts rattling off a string of angry complaints.#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Eren##br#
"That Mholt! Seriously! He is the most anNOYing Hoppalong I've ever MET!#br#
 It's the same thing every DAY! Carrying about all that stupid hair he lost, looking for#br#
 pity from some poor sap. Sure, sure, at FIRST, everyone wants to comfort him, but when#br#
 it's the same thing day after DAY? C'mon! I barely have enough empathy for ONE day!" #M810010s100+30$Eren$825$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"But Mholt really does look like he's suffering...#br#
 The poor guy. All he wants is some hair! I'd probably be the same way!#br#
 I can understand why he's so sensitive about it...#br#
 Isn't there ANYthing we can do to help?"#pets100+30$$831$$0$0#

#&7$Eren##br#
"What? Since when do Hoppalong men cry so easily? There's only one excuse#br# for them to cry, and that's when they get their heart broken! Crying over this is#br# 
 just... just... well, it's just riDONKulous!" Eren continues getting worked up#br#
 until Silus gives him a timely jab in the back.
   #M810010s100+30$Eren$825$$1$0#

#&7$Eren##br#
"All right, all right! I MAY have overreacted a bit and gotten snippy...#br# I don't really think he's a CRYbaby, per say, but, I-... well, I'm sorry. I guess I#br#
 did go a little overboard." Eren scratches his head, thoroughly ashamed of himself.
    
   #M810010s100+30$Eren$826$$1$0#

#&7$Silus##br#
 Silus silently nods his head, then pokes at a map that's sticking out from Eren's pocket.#br#
 Eren—as though suddenly remembering—quickly pulls it out and bounds over to#br#
 show you. #M811010s100+30$Silus$1$$0$0#

#&7$Eren##br#
"Actually, actually! Silus and I've been working behind the scenes to help Mholt.#br#
 There was even a rumor going around about Agatha's hair and we tried pulling it.#br#
 Of course, she beat us half to death. Still, no matter what we tried, Mholt's hair never grew.#br# So, we figured we'd see if Enkidu might know how to fix all this. He's so wise!"
   #M810010s100+30$Eren$831$$1$0#

#&7$Eren##br#
"We marked the meeting place that #&46$Enkidu# told us here on this map,#br#
 but you saw how Mholt reacted when I told him.#br# I probably need to give him some space for a while.#br#
 So, could you to go and #&46$ask Enkidu and give Mholt his suggestions#?" #M810010s100+30$Eren$831$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You and %p% agree and Eren hands you the map. Eren may have quite the #br#
 loose tongue, but he really is a kind-hearted Hoppalong deep inside...#char$$4$$0$0#|
51362|#&7$Mholt##br#
 Meanwhile, Mholt continues to whimper.#br#
 For now, it won't exactly be easy talking to him. #M805010s100+30$Mholt$827$$1$0#|
51363|#&7$%n%##br#
 While searching for Mholt, formula in hand,#br#
 you accidentally run smack into him, his face still soaked with tears,#br#"talking with" Eren. #M810010s100+30$Eren$1$$1$0#

#&7$Mholt##br#
"Look! Another hair just fell out! Oh, what I should do...? This is all your fault!"#br# A hysterical Mholt holds a clump of hair up to Eren with a shaking paw.#br#
 Eren, however, doesn't even glance over—thoroughly engrossed in his game of#br# cards with Silus.
   #M805010s100+30$Mholt$831$$0$0#

#&7$Eren##br#
"Hey, hey! Look, Silus! I drew the 'Hair' card! You take it! Oh, oh, oh!#br# The 'Seaweed' card?! Man, oh, man! How'd you draw that, huh?#br#
 How'd you draw that, huh?#br# How'd you draw that?  You really ARE something!"  #M810010s100+30$Eren$831$$1$0#

#&7$Eren##br#
"Hold on a second and let me see. Maybe I'll draw the 'Turnip' next. Hahaha!#br# You'll have a hard time drawing the 'Soul' card, Silus, seeing as how you don't have one!"#br#
 Eren continues to ramble about his game, but Silus simply stands there, at a complete#br#
 loss for words. #M810010s100+30$Eren$831$$1$0#

#&7$Mholt##br#
"Are you guys talking about me again? I just heard you talking about seaweed#br# 
 and turnips. Don't you know I already TRIED that remedy? It doesn't work!#br#
 Nothing works!!" Mholt lets the clump of hair fall from his hand before grabbing#br#
 Eren by the neck and shaking him violently. #M805010s100+30$Mholt$825$$0$0#

#&7$Eren##br#
"S-stop... shaking... me... I'm... gonna be... sick...!!#br#
 I'm trying to... s-save you! H-help me, %n%!"#br#
 Eren gets dizzier by the second, his eyes pleading with you.
      #M810010s100+30$Eren$827$$1$0#

#&7$Mholt##br#
"Save? Me? You'd better not be lying to me.#br#
 Otherwise neither I nor my lost hair will EVER forgive you!"#br#
 Mholt releases Eren and turns to you.#br#
"%n% and %p%, You can... fix this disaster on my head?" #M805010s100+30$Mholt$831$$0$0#

#&7$Eren##br#
"I'm not about to let myself be hated by a little baby who can't even hold onto his hair..."#br#
 Mholt turns and stares daggers at Eren, who quickly changes the subject.#br#
"Ehem. Well then, did Enkidu give you anything useful?"#br#
 Eren asks, rubbing his sore shoulders. #M810010s100+30$Eren$831$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You hand Mholt Enkidu's hair-growth formula.#br#
 Mholt examines it skeptically, eyebrow cocked.#br#
 As you explain its purpose,#br#
 His eyes light up immediately and fill with desperate hope.#char$$4$$1$0#

#&7$Mholt##br#
"%n%, %p% thank you so much!#br#
 And Enkidu, too, I suppose... Well, that's all for now. I need to go give this stuff a try.#br#
 So, if you all don't mind, I'd like to be alone for a while..."#br#
 Mholt quickly starts to prepare the formula. #M805010s100+30$Mholt$824$$0$0#|
51364|#&7$Enkidu##br#
"Oh? It's you two.#br#
 Please tell me Eren and Silus didn't run into trouble?"#br#
 Enkidu asks, eyebrows raised and a look of surprise on his face. #M813010s100+30$Enkidu$4$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You relay the tale to Enkidu in great detail, and then#br#
 explain that you've come on behalf of the two arguing Hoppalongs.#br#
 Hearing this, Enkidu lets out a chuckle.#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Enkidu##br#
"Oh, those two. THIS is what they called on me about?#br#
 Wouldn't it make more sense to just go straight to a Hoppalong doctor?"#br#
 Enkidu pauses for a moment, a sly smile playing on his lips.
   #M813010s100+30$Enkidu$831$$1$0#

#&7$Enkidu##br#
"Still... I do have a formula that can regrow hair.#br#
 Now, it's not for ME, if that's what you're thinking. I am far above caring about a little hair.#br#
 This formula is just a little something I picked up while I was studying medicine.#br#
 It works like a charm, but..."#M813010s100+30$Enkidu$831$$1$0#

#&7$Enkidu##br#
"Just one thing... You have to make sure to dilute it before using it.#br#
 As they say, a divine mist shall descend upon the scarecrows of the glen. #br# Or was it scarecrows of the valley? In any case, it must be diluted. Here, take  #br#
 the formula." Enkidu scribbles the formula on a piece of paper and gives it to you.  
   #M813010s100+30$Enkidu$831$$1$0#

#&7$Enkidu##br#
"I think that about does it. And, now, I must retire. If you'll excuse me.#br# In the words of a great master, the dreaming fox must dip his tail twice in the dew.#br#
 Until we meet again,%p% and %n%." Once he manages to fight back the yawns,#br# Enkidu waves goodbye and wanders off.
  
   #M813010s100+30$Enkidu$4$$1$0#|
51370|Mholt has started cooking up his latest hair growth formula, but he's discovered he's missing a key ingredient—soft shells.

The recipe requires constant stirring, so Mholt asks you to go to Sporefall Core, defeat some Ironshell Drones, and gather their Soft Shells. Better get back quick, before the recipe is ruined and you reap the wrath of Mholt's, erm, hair triggered temper. |
51371|#&7$Mholt##br#
"Hmm...%n% ...%p% ,#br#
 "Can you ... do me ... a favor ...?"#br#
 Mholt asks, stirring the pot of dark liquid furiously. #M805010s100+30$Mholt$602$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"What kind of favor?#br#
 And...are you sure that hair-growth stuff is supposed to be...that color?#br#
 Did you dilute it like the recipe said?"#br#
 %p% glances into the pot suspiciously.#pets100+30$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Mholt##br#
"Dilute? Uhh, hehehe, yeah...about that.#br#
 When it's ready, I'll only use a tiny bit..."#br#
 Mholt replies sheepishly. #M805010s100+30$Mholt$602$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"You didn't dilute it at all, did you?"#br#
 %p% says, shaking his head.#pets100+30$$831$$0$0#

#&7$Mholt##br#
"It doesn't matter...#br#
 It'll be more effective this way. Yikes!#br#
 While I've been busy talking to you, it's started curdling! That's not good!"#br#
 Frantically, Mholt stirs as fast as his arms will allow. #M805010s100+30$Mholt$602$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Oh, wow that looks like hard word.#br#
 Want us to help stir, too?"#br#
 %p% reaches out to take the stirring stick from Mholt.#pets100+30$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Mholt##br#
"Ahhhh! No! Don't touch it!#br#
 Don't touch my remedy!!"#br#
 Half-crazed, Mholt uses his body to block %p% and continues stirring. #M805010s100+30$Mholt$827$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You watch as Mholt becomes increasingly delirious,#br#
 and while it is a bit irritating at times, there's something absurdly funny about the Hoppalong.#br#
 You decide to ask him what he needs help with.#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Mholt##br#
"Umm, sorry. I got so busy, it slipped my mind.#br#
 Actually... While I was getting all the ingredients, I realized I was missing #&46$Soft Shells#.#br#
 As you can see, I'm a little tied up here right now..."#br#
 Mholt wipes the sweat from his brow with his paw, all the while continuing to stir relentlessly. #M805010s100+30$Mholt$602$$1$0#

#&7$Mholt##br#
"#&46$You can only find Soft Shells on the bodies of the Baby Ironshell Drones in the Sporefall Core#.#br#
 If you could... please hurry and grab me some.#br#
 My arms are getting sore... I don't know how much longer I can keep this up..."#br#
 Mholt looks exhausted. #M805010s100+30$Mholt$602$$1$0#|
51372|#&7$Eren##br#
"If that formula is from Enkidu, then it must be good.#br#
 Once Mholt has his hair back, we'll finally be able to give our ears a rest.#br#
 Wouldn't you say so, Silus? I've never missed silence so much." #M810010s100+30$Eren$4$$1$0#|
51373|#&7$Mholt##br#
"%n% and %p%, you're finally back...#br#
 Quick! Drop the Soft Shells in.#br#
 Don't touch anything else, though..."#br#
 Mholt mutters feebly. It looks like he's about to pass out. #M805010s100+30$Mholt$602$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You and %p% do as instructed#br#
 and carefully place the Soft Shells into the mixture.#br#
 Mholt summons the last of his strength, stirring for all he's worth.#br#
 Surprisingly, the thick, inky mixture gradually becomes clear.#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Whoa. It looks like it worked."#br#
 %p% stares at the glistening remedy, eyes alight.#pets100+30$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Mholt##br#
 Finally, the once-black potion becomes as clear as normal water.#br#
 Mholt finally stops stirring, a look of satisfaction on his face. #M805010s100+30$Mholt$1$$1$0#

#&7$Mholt##br#
"It's... It's done...#br#
 Please... Please, get me a cup..."#br#
 Mholt crouches low to catch his breath. He then points at a clear glass. #M805010s100+30$Mholt$301$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Mholt, why don't you take a breather first, then test out the potion?"#br#
 %p% asks as he passes the glass.#pets100+30$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Mholt##br#
"No..."#br#
 Mholt stares wide-eyed at the glass.#br#
I've been waiting for this...for too long..."#br#
 He raises his head and stares at the elixir. A strange smile drives away any hint of exhaustion. #M805010s100+30$Mholt$831$$1$0#

#&7$Mholt##br#
"All those stupid people laughing at my troubles...#br#
 All those senseless accusations...#br#
 Well, it ends today..."#br#
 Mholt slowly pours a cupful as he speaks. #M805010s100+30$Mholt$831$$1$0#

#&7$Mholt##br#
"Mortals...#br#
 You should cherish the time you have left...#br#
 Because now this world... will be changed forever!"#br#
 After Mholt finishes, he guzzles the entire glass of potion. #M805010s100+30$Mholt$824$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Hmm... I guess Mholt's lost his marbles along with his hair..."#br#
 %p% says to you, awestruck. You simply shrug your shoulders.#pets100+30$$1$$0$0#

#&7$Mholt##br#
"Ooo... I feel... so powerful.#br#
 Like my body is full of energy... and it's ready to burst out...#br#
 Ooo, this is..."#br#
 Mholt jerks suddenly and trembles all over. #M805010s100+30$Mholt$501$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"This must be a side effect. He should've just diluted it...#br#
 Mholt, are you ok?"#br#
 %p% steps forward to check on Mholt.#pets100+30$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Mholt##br#
"No! Stay away from me!#br#
 This power... I can't control it...#br#
 Get out of here... At this rate... I don't know how long I'll be able to hold back!"#br#
 Mholt shouts, waving frantically for you to stay away. #M805010s100+30$Mholt$825$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Mholt, give it a rest...#br#
 Huh? What the...? Uh... %n%, are you seeing what I'm seeing?..#br#
 Is Mholt... getting bigger...?"#br#
 Now that %p% mentions it, you do notice something off about the Hoppalong.#pets100+30$$825$$0$0#

#&7$Mholt##br#
"Hehehehe,#br#
 I want... more!#br#
 Muwahaha!"#br#
 A creepy smile spreads across Mholt's lips as he continues to grow. #M805010s100+30$Mholt$824$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"%n%... this can't be right...#br#
 Should we... run or something?.."#br#
 %p% glances fearfully at you.#pets100+30$$831$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You then notice something; Mholt has actually gotten any bigger.#br#
 It's only his fur. It's grown so fast that he's just puffed up.#br#
 %p% finally calms down when you point that out.#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Mholt##br#
"Haha! Quick, feast your eyes on the new Mholt!#br#
 I'll never go bald again for as long as I live!"#br#
 You can barely make out Mholt's voice from within the giant furball. #M805010s100+30$Mholt$4$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 At this point, Mholt has become nothing but a big ball of fuzz.#br#
 Still, judging by his loud cheers, he doesn't seem to care.#br#
 You and %p% look at each other, not exactly sure how to react.#br#
 After thinking for a bit, you ask if Mholt needs any help solving this problem, too.#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Mholt##br#
"What? What problem?#br#
 I've never felt better.#br#
 This is all thanks to you and %p%'s help. Oh, and Enkidu, too. Can't forget him.#br#
 There's got to be a way I can repay you." #M805010s100+30$Mholt$822$$1$0#

#&7$Mholt##br#
"Still, I'd really like to be alone with all my hair right now.#br#
 Ahhh, so relaxing. The whole world seems different. Happier. Brighter.#br#
 I haven't a care in the world... I'm as light as a feather."#M805010s100+30$Mholt$831$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 The large puff-ball known as Mholt rolls all around.#br#
 It's like he's completely tuned out everything...#br#
 All you can do is let things develop naturally.#char$$826$$0$0#|
51380|Ever since Mholt has become a giant furball, he's been rolling around and causing quite the commotion. The floors have never been so clean, but Mholt keeps rolling into everyone and he's liable to break something. Eren is at wit's end.

In desperation, he's asked you to go to the Sporefall Core to find Enkidu. Surely he must know how to solve this new dilemma.|
51381|#&7$Eren##br#
"Ahhh! It's so, so, so annoying!#br#
 You see that dust bunny rolling along its merry way, giggling like an idiot?#br#
 It's really, really, really making me mad!" #M810010s100+30$Eren$825$$1$0#

#&7$Silus##br#
 Silus smiles and watches the puff-ball tumbling around nearby.#br#
 You can hear muffled laughter as well.#br#
 But when he notices you looking at him,#br#
 he quickly clamps his mouth shut. #M811010s100+30$Silus$1$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"But Mholt looks so happy...#br#
 Isn't that a good thing?"#pets100+30$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Eren##br#
"What's good about it? It's the most annoying thing I've ever seen! Ever!#br#
 If he keeps carrying on like this, Mholt is going to cause more problems than before.#br#
 I guarantee Bain thinks his companion's annoying too, even if he doesn't say so!" #M810010s100+30$Eren$825$$1$0#

#&7$Eren##br#
"Look at Mholt, rolling around like that. He's completely covered in dirt.#br#
 First, he was the baldest Hoppalong. Now, he's the filthiest! It's shameful.#br#
 He's making us all look bad. I'd rather listen to him whine about losing his fur every day#br# than see him acting like this. We've got to do something to put an end to this!"#br#
     #M810010s100+30$Eren$831$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Well... What if you told him to brush it?#br#
 Or maybe... shave some off or something?"#pets100+30$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Eren##br#
"%p%, don't be so naive. Don't you think I've tried that?#br#
 The other day, Silus and I grabbed Mholt and cut off all we could.#br#
 He cried like a stuck pig!#br#
 Worse still, the next day he had grown it all back and was rolling around again..."#M810010s100+30$Eren$831$$1$0#

"That remedy was way too effective...#br#
 It's unnatural."#br#
 %p% says with a frown.#pets100+30$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Eren##br#
"I know, right? This whole furball thing has gone far enough!#br#
 Looks like we'll have to go #&46$find Enkidu and see if there is any way to end this mess#.#br#
 It might hurt Mholt, but it's for everyone's own good, including his."#br#
 Eren closes his eyes and wrings his hands. Unfortunately, he has a very good point. #M810010s100+30$Eren$831$$1$0#

#&7$Eren##br#
"It's settled. %n% and %p%, let's split up and get going.#br#

"Oh, hey %p%. Hey %n%.#br#
 We've certainly been seeing a lot of each other these days, huh.#br#

 Enkidu laughs until he can barely wheeze. #M813010s100+30$Enkidu$831$$1$0#

#&7$Enkidu##br#
"Mholt's in a world of trouble and yet he's still so happy.#br#
 I just have to see this for myself. It's been so long since I saw any of them.#br#
 Although, I can safely say this was not the way I expected to see them again."#br# Enkidu wipes the tears of laughter from his eyes, but can't keep more from welling up.

"Enkidu... Does this mean you'll come help?"#br#
 %p% looks at him.#pets100+30$$1$$0$0#

#&7$Enkidu##br#
"Why not? As a great teacher once said, where the wind blows, a leaf must follow.#br#
 Truth be told, I've never actually dealt with this sort of thing before.#br#
 I'll need to see exactly what's going on before I can actually do anything.#br#
 It's been so long since I saw something worth getting excited over. I wouldn't miss it." #M813010s100+30$Enkidu$831$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Enkidu finishes packing his sack and then starts whistling once more as he leads the way.#br#
 %p% looks at him with awe and respect.#br#
 You note that though Enkidu said that Mholt is in imminent danger,#br#
 he's taking his sweet time. Hopefully that means Mholt's condition isn't that serious...right?#char$$826$$0$0#|
51385|#&7$Mholt##br#
"Let me go!#br#
 You're just jealous of my luxurious fur, aren't you?#br#
 There's no need to be petty. I'll be generous and share the formula with you!"#br#
 Mholt grumbles as he struggles to get loose. #M805010s100+30$Mholt$827$$1$0#

#&7$Eren##br#
"Heh, just give up, already.  You can't get away from me you big fuzzball!#br#
 And I can barely hear your raspy voice through that fur, anyway. Just sit down!"#br#
 Eren says, smiling craftily. #M810010s100+30$Eren$1$$0$0#

#&7$Enkidu##br#
"What's so funny over here?#br#
 And what's that big ball of lint with ears? Did you get some new-age furniture?#br# And it moves too? Marvellous!"
 Enkidu strolls towards the squabbling Hoppalongs. #M813010s100+30$Enkidu$4$$0$0#

#&7$Eren##br#
"Huh? Enkidu? You came in person?#br#
 "Does that mean Mholt..."#br#
 Eren releases Mholt, suddenly very concerned. #M810010s100+30$Eren$831$$1$0#

#&7$Mholt##br#
"Here he comes, my savior! Enkidu, my hero!#br#
 Thank you so much.#br#
 Please, allow me to show you my gratitude... Ergh..."#br#
 Mholt attempts a bow, but doesn't get very far seeing as he resembles a bean bag. #M805010s100+30$Mholt$822$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Seeing the ball of fur that is Mholt try to bow,#br#
 everyone collapses in a fit of laughter.#br#
 In the end, Mholt gives up, gasping for air.#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Enkidu##br#
"All right, Mholt. No need for all the politesse. I'm just a wanderer now.#br#
 We'll forego the bows this time.#br#
 Anyway, more to the point. You didn't dilute the formula like I said, did you?"#br#
 Enkidu tries to conceal his giggly tears behind a mask of pseudo-seriousness. #M813010s100+30$Enkidu$4$$0$0#

#&7$Mholt##br#
"I... I was worried that if I used too little, it wouldn't work#br#
 and my fur wouldn't grow... so I..."#br#
 Mholt says sheepishly, his voice trailing off. #M805010s100+30$Mholt$1$$1$0#

#&7$Enkidu##br#
"The mixture stimulates your hair follicles to make your fur grow.#br#
 But if you use too much, they'll become over-stimulated#br#
 and they'll start to die and fall out much faster. Do you understand?"#br#
 Enkidu's smile slowly fades and he shakes his head solemnly as he finishes his piece. #M813010s100+30$Enkidu$1$$0$0#

#&7$Mholt##br#
"Then... that means..."#br#
 Mholt looks at his fur in shock. It suddenly feels like a prison. #M805010s100+30$Mholt$831$$1$0#

#&7$Eren##br#
"Hahahaha! See, Mholt? At this rate, you won't have a single hair left on you #br#
 and then you really WILL be the baldest Hoppalong in history!"#br#
 Eren gloats, painting Mholt a very vivid picture of his eventual fate. #M810010s100+30$Eren$4$$0$0#

#&7$Mholt##br#
"I... can't... no!#br#
 It's bad enough being bald... But being completely hairless...#br#
 "Enkidu! You've got to help me!"#br#
 Mholt pleads, hoarse with desperation. #M805010s100+30$Mholt$825$$1$0#

#&7$Enkidu##br#
"All right, now... this might hurt a bit, but you'll simply have to deal with it.#br# As a wise master once said, 'where there is no pain, neither can any gain#br#
 result' ... a catchy expression, don't you think?" Enkidu strides forward,#br#
 cracking his knuckles.
   #M813010s100+30$Enkidu$1$$0$0#
 
#&7$Eren##br#
"Oh, this is going to be good."#br#
 Eren looks at Mholt and smiles mischievously. #M810010s100+30$Eren$831$$0$0#

#&7$Enkidu##br#
"Turn around. All of you. You mustn't watch."#br#
 Enkidu says calmly. #M813010s100+30$Enkidu$1$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
"Now!"#br#
 Everyone whips around on their heels.#br#
 Hearing Mholt's groans and the sound of fur being ripped out,#br#
 you can't help but feel sorry for him.#char$$825$$1$0#

#&7$Enkidu##br#
"All done. Listen, all of you. Next time, when your master says something,#br#
 you should listen. EsPECIAlly if it's ME. Got it?" Enkidu scolds with a sigh.  
   Do you understand?"#br#
   #M813010s100+30$Enkidu$831$$0$0#

#&7$Silus##br#
"Yes, sir!"#br#
 The Hoppalongs say in unison.#br#
 To your surprise, even Silus pipes up. #M811010s100+30$Silus$1$$1$0#

#&7$Mholt##br#
"Erm... M-Mr. Enkidu?#br#
 Do you think...I can still use the formula?#br#
 D-d-don't worry! I'll definitely, DEFINITELY dilute it this time."#br#
 Mholt asks timidly, back to his old, pitiful self. #M805010s100+30$Mholt$826$$1$0#

#&7$Enkidu##br#
"Afraid not. After what I just did,#br#
 this formula won't do a thing anymore.  I'm telling you this as a friend—just let it go." #M813010s100+30$Enkidu$831$$0$0#

#&7$Enkidu##br#
"Well, it seems like you've all done a lot of growing up. That's fantastic to see.#br#
 Seems like this trip was worth it after all. I'll be off, then. See you all later."#br#
 Enkidu yawns and slowly wanders off again. #M813010s100+30$Enkidu$301$$0$0#

#&7$Mholt##br#
"M-My beautiful hair... b-but why...?#br#
 Oh, what a world... what a cruel, unforgiving, desolate WORLD."#br#
 Mholt clutches the clumps of fallen fur and cries. #M805010s100+30$Mholt$826$$1$0#

#&7$Delphia##br#

"Oh... Oh, it's you...#br#

#&7$Marvin##br#
"There's a wealthy man in Elysium and his son is a very picky eater.#br#

 In a flash, Marvin goes from friendly to upset.#br#
 All the depression he'd been bottling up explodes at once. #M812010s100+30$Marvin$825$$1$0#

"It's exactly like all the books say! It's the hardest, most durable material...#br#
 But no matter what method I use, I can't work it at all!#br#
 I can't even scratch it, let along make a Helmet out of it! So all that hard work was for nothing!"#br#

"Oh no, please don't be upset... Wait, before you go, I have some good news...#br#
 Since that rich guy offered a pretty good price for the Spyrosaur Eyeballs,#br#

"This is my client's weekly meal list."#br#

#&7$Karen##br#
"... No, I mean, Marvin had you fooled from the beginning.#br#
 The wooden statue he showed you... was probably already broken."#br#

 you guess this isn't the first time that's happened. #M809010s100+30$Karen$831$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You think back to how Marvin was holding the statue. Now, things start to seem a little more suspicious.#br#

#&7$Karen##br#
"I'll come with you to find Marvin.#br#

 her solemn tone weighs down on Marvin with incredible pressure. #M809010s100+30$Karen$1$$0$0#

#&7$Marvin##br#
"OK, OK! I understand what you're trying to say,#br#
 but business is business, see?"#br#
 Marvin quickly takes the Swampfang Lurker Tails from your hands. #M812010s100+30$Marvin$831$$1$0#

#&7$Marvin##br#
"%n% and %p%,#br#
 Consider your current debt wiped clean#br#
 You don't need to worry about me anymore."#br#
 Marvin says to you, though his gaze does not leave Karen for an instant. #M812010s100+30$Marvin$1$$1$0#

#&7$Karen##br#
"Not only that,#br#
 you'd better give them fair compensation for all the other work they've done for you."#br#
 Karen scowls at Marvin's half-hearted attempt at reconciliation.#br#
 She snatches a bag full of Slithering Dragolizard Jaws so Marvin can't leave. #M809010s100+30$Karen$831$$0$0#

#&7$Marvin##br#
"What are you saying?#br#
 I've been in this business for years#br#
 and I've never heard such an outrageous claim!"#br#
 Karen's aggressive tone has pushed Marvin to wit's end. #M812010s100+30$Marvin$825$$1$0#

#&7$Marvin##br#
"Hmph! You want my money? No way! I don't have money!#br#
 Take my life, Karen, if you've got the guts!"#br#
 Marvin turns up his nose and puffs out his chest.#br#
 It's the courage of a martyr. #M812010s100+30$Marvin$827$$1$0#

#&7$Karen##br#
"You... still don't...show even a shred of remorse..."#br#
 Karen grinds her teeth in anger.#br#
 Her hair stands on end. #M809010s100+30$Karen$831$$0$0#

#&7$Marvin##br#
"Who asked you anyhow?#br#
 What makes you think you can just stick your nose in other people's business!#br#
 Just because you're a noble...do you think you can do whatever you want?"#br#
 Marvin looks at Karen with his paws on his hips. #M812010s100+30$Marvin$1$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
"Grrr!"#br#
 Things have suddenly gotten very heated.#br#
 You swear you can see a tendril of smoke coming from Karen's right ear...#br#
 It seems she's literally losing her cool.#char$$823$$0$0#

#&7$Karen##br#
"Marvin... Y-You're done!#br#
 Once and for all! I'm going to cure you of that foul attitude of yours!!"#br#
 Faced with Marvin's disdain,#br#
 Karen throws away her years of noble etiquette and lets loose the wild anger inside her. #M809010s100+30$Karen$825$$0$0#

#&7$Marvin##br#
"You're one#br#
 to talk about foul attitudes!"#br#
 Hearing that, Karen looks like she's about to erupt,#br#
 but Marvin doesn't change in the slightest and continues to needle her. #M812010s100+30$Marvin$831$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You watch the two Hoppalongs argue,#br#
 and decide to put an end to it.#br#
 But just as you're about to break it up...

#&7$Karen and Marvin##br#
"%n%, this is between Marvin and me!"#br#
"%n% , don't tell me you actually want to have that stupid debt hanging over you!"#br#
 Karen and Marvin exclaim in unison. #M809010s100+30$Karen$1$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 With Karen and Marvin both yelling over each other, you can't get a word in edgewise#br#

#&7$%p%##br#
"%n%, let's get out of here...#br#

"Sniff... Sniff... %p%...#br#

 It's too much. I can't report to her on my own... #&46$Could you please come with me?# Sob..."#br#

 Louis can't bring himself to be around Karen.#br#
 A feeling of dread washes over you...#char$$826$$0$0#|
51422|#&7$Karen##br#
 Karen remains stone-faced.#br#
 Her expression doesn't flinch as she scans the information she's holding.#br#
 Now and then, her brow furrows.#br#
 The very air around her seems to warn you to keep away. #M809010s100+30$Karen$1$$1$0#|
51423|#&7$Karen##br#
"So, how's your friend Marvin...?"#br#
 Karen looks up at you, disturbed. #M809010s100+30$Karen$831$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You fill Karen in on the details about Marvin.#char$$821$$0$0#

#&7$Karen##br#
"I see... Yes, well, at the very least,#br#
 we didn't cause any trouble for him.#br#
 Thank you %n%, %p%."#br#
 Karen sighs like she'd been holding her breath all day and her familiar, gentle demeanor returns. #M809010s100+30$Karen$822$$1$0#

#&7$Karen##br#
"Well...What do you want to ask?#br# Louis, you still have a quest to report, right?"#br#
 Karen spies Louis hiding in the back#br#
 and smiles warmly. #M809010s100+30$Karen$1$$1$0#

#&7$Louis##br#
"Yes, yes. Just one moment. I'll be right there!"#br#
 Seeing Karen back to her old self, Louis steps out from behind the stone column.#br#
"%n%, %p%, thank you... !"#br#
 Louis says softly as he passes you. #M804010s100+30$Louis$822$$1$0#|
51424|#&7$Karen##br#
 Karen's cold facade is visible, even from afar.#br#
 Her expression doesn't flinch as she scans the information she's holding.#br#
 Looking more closely, you see her forehead knit slightly every once in a while.#br#
 The very air around her seems to warn you to keep away. #M809010s100+30$Karen$1$$1$0#

#&7$Louis##br#
"K-Karen's been like that... *hick* ...a lot recently...#br# I don't dare go anywhere near her... *hick* ..."#br#
 As you enter, Louis hides behind %p%.#br# Seeing Karen, Louis's ears droop in fear.  
  
   #M804010s100+30$Louis$826$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You're already here. There's no reason to be afraid.#br#
 So you whip up your courage and go to greet Karen.#char$$825$$0$0#

#&7$Karen##br#
"Oh my, %n%... and...? Oh! Louis, you're here too!#br#
 I was just thinking about you... You have a quest to report, right?"#br#
 Karen smiles, but her frightening aura still remains. #M809010s100+30$Karen$822$$1$0#

#&7$Louis##br#
"Oh... Ka-Karen! Please have mercy!"#br#
 Louis is so terrified, his ears have shrunk back.#br#
 He seems to have completely forgotten about the quest he was to report. #M804010s100+30$Louis$827$$0$0#

#&7$Karen##br#
"Yes... well %n% and %p%... #br#
 What can I do for you?"#br#
 Karen's smile has all the warmth of a wicked mask. She then turns to look at you.#br#
 Now even %p% cowers behind you. #M809010s100+30$Karen$1$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Seeing Louis and %p% act like this, you take a deep breath#br#
 and warily approach the terrifying creature who seems so unlike the Karen you know.#br# You ask why she's been acting so...harsh lately.#char$$821$$0$0#
  

#&7$Karen##br#
"Huh...? Oh...*sigh*...#br#
 It's because of that argument I had with Marvin..."#br#
 Karen seems surprised at your question.#br#
 She hesitates a moment, but finally continues. #M809010s100+30$Karen$826$$1$0#

#&7$Karen##br#
"We argued for so long but nothing came of it.#br#
 In the end, we both stormed off, madder than ever.#br#
 Since then, I've just been doing some soul-searching.#br#
 I really shouldn't have said those things to him..."#M809010s100+30$Karen$1$$1$0#

#&7$Karen##br#
"I... kind of want to apologize to Marvin.#br#
 But I'm too ashamed of myself...#br#
 Oh, this is so frustrating!"#br#
 Karen seems really upset.  #M809010s100+30$Karen$825$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Ka-Karen,#br#
 Why don't %n% and I go and apologize to Marvin for you?"#br#
 %p% steps out from behind you.#br#
 but you notice his knees trembling.#pets100+30$$2$$0$0#

#&7$Karen##br#
"Really? It moved? That would be wonderful!#br#
 Thanks for your help,"#br#
 Karen says,#br#
 though her frightening smile doesn't change. #M809010s100+30$Karen$822$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You both slink away quickly.#br#
 Once you've calmed down, you think of Marvin...#br#
 You don't know much about him other than he loves money.#char$$2$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 But, you can't just send Marvin money as an apology.#br#
 Things like jewels or treasure would also probably be inappropriate#br#
 to send on Karen's behalf.#char$$826$$1$0#

 seeing your confusion.#pets100+30$$4$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Hm...%p% is right!#br#
 We should give Marvin what he wants.#br#
 You decide to head into #&46$the depths of Marsh Abyss# again#br#
 to #&46$collect enough Swirl Dragolizard's Jaws# as a way of making it up to him.#char$$806$$1$0#|
51425|#&7$Marvin##br#
"Ah, it's you. What can I do for you?#br#
 What are these? Slithering Dragolizard Jaws?
 Are you absolutely positive?#br# I'm not giving you a dime, just so you know!"#br#
 Marvin accepts the jaws, doubt dancing in his eyes. #M812010s100+30$Marvin$4$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"We don't want you to pay us.#br#
 This... this is from Karen. She wants to make it up to you.#br#
 She hopes you'll accept her apology."#pets100+30$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Marvin##br#
"Huh? Karen? Why does she want to apologize to me and send me this?"#br# Why does she want to apologize to me#br#
 and send me this?"#br#
 Marvin asks,#br#
 staring at you with utter confusion, as though you're a newly discovered foreign species. #M812010s100+30$Marvin$2$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You explain to him that#br#
 Karen has taken their argument to heart.#br#
 She realizes that she shouldn't have yelled at him#br#
 and hopes that he can forgive her.#char$$821$$0$0#

#&7$Marvin##br#
"Oh, that argument... well, I plum forgot all about it.#br#
 Nobles certainly are strange creatures, wouldn't you say?#br#
 They're always pining for more respect,#br#
 and they're obsessed with trivial matters." #M812010s100+30$Marvin$831$$1$0#

#&7$Marvin##br#
"Tell her it doesn't matter.#br#
 Come on. I've got to focus on my business now,"#br#
 Marvin mutters, putting the Swirl Dragolizard's Jaws into his backpack#br#

"I never thought you'd actually follow Lelouch's orders.#br#

 After grabbing the leather sack, Omi knocks out the Slithering Dragolizards and cleans them.#br#
 Humming a tuneless melody, he places the whole Slithering Dragolizards into the prepared pastry.#br#
 After adding a few shakes of spices and crimping the edges, he places it into the oven.#M803010s100+30$Omi$2$$1$0#

 You and %p% decide to risk his cooking one more time.#br#
 You muster all your courage, squinch your eyes shut, and shove the forkful into your mouth.#char$$821$$0$0#

51690|To catch the legendary Aqualord, you'll need to research what kind of fishing bait you should use.

Go to Echo Mine and catch some Sea Turtles. Supposedly they're related to Aqualords. If you observe a turtle maybe you could find out what kind of food they like. You seem to recall that turtles eat pizza, but that sounds a little weird. Better check to be sure.

#&7$Marvin##br#
"Firstly, the Aqualord is a subspecies of the Armordillo.#br#
 Secondly, it dwells in the eastern part of Viridian Forest.#br#
 Thirdly, obviously, there's no way it'll eat anything Omi's cooked. It's not stupid!" #M812010s100+30$Marvin$831$$1$0#

#&7$Marvin##br#
"Fourthly, it eats only one type of creature.#br#
 And finally, fifthly... it only eats... wait for it... Hoppalongs!" #M812010s100+30$Marvin$831$$1$0#

"What??
 It only eats one thing?#br#

#&7$Marvin##br#
"I told you I wouldn't repeat myself!#br#
 Whether you believe me or not, that's the honest truth.#br#
 I'd better be off. I've more important things to attend to." #M812010s100+30$Marvin$351$$1$0#|

And I've finally come up#br#with a real whizbang—Spider Leg Ratatouille!"     #M803010s100+30$Omi$1$$1$0##&7$Omi##br#"Don't look so agog, kids! I know it's impressive, but you'll give me a complex! The only#br#problem with this brand-spankin' new recipe I'd like to try out is that I'm missing#br#one key component—the ingredients. And by ingredients, I mean the hairiest,#br#gnarliest spider legs you've ever grossed yourself out just by looking at!"   #M803010s100+30$Omi$831$$1$0#|
51902|#&7$Omi##br#"Now, I may be an amazing cook, but that doesn't make me an amazing#br#ingredient-procurer, if you know what I mean. That's where you two come in! Think you#br#could get me some spider legs from those Terrorantulas? Huh? I don't know how#br#you could say no after hearing about the amazing dish I'll cook up with 'em!" #M803010s100+30$Omi$4$$1$0#|
51903|#&7$Omi##br# "Ohoho, yesssss... YESSSSS! Look at that sinew! Look at that hair! These spider legs#br# should do JUST the trick! Give them to me!

Spider legs flailing, he begins chopping the thick, meaty legs#br# into minute slices before siphoning the yellowish juice off into a separate bowl. Upon#br#finishing, he unsheathes a plethora of shells from his bag and begins cracking them in#br#two, letting the gooey, slimy inside seep down into the bowl of leg slices. #M803010s100+30$Omi$2091$$1$0##&7$Omi##br#"A little bit of this! A little bit of that! Into the vat you go!" Omi hums to himself as he uses#br#an electric blender to mince everything into an unrecognizable, greenish-brown#br#paste. "And voilà! Spider Leg Ratatouille! The ultimate fine dining experience!" #M803010s100+30$Omi$822$$1$0##&7$Omi##br#Omi carefully takes the contents of the vat and spoons it onto a plate. You think of#br#mentioning to Omi that ratatouille doesn't normally look like a diarrhea smoothie,#br#but you ultimately decide to refrain yourself. #M803010s100+30$Omi$831$$1$0##&7$%n%##br#As Omi begins walking towards the two of you with the chunky concoction, %p%'s#br#head turns 180 degrees backwards to shoot you a look of pure, unadulterated fear. #char$$821$$0$0##&7$%p%##br#Omi places the dish in %p%'s hands, and you can actually see the fumes drifting up#br#from its filmy surface to marble around %p%'s nose. %p%'s body quivers,#br#trembles, undulates as the nauseating odor envelopes their entire body. "So...#br#captivating..." They stare down at the gooey slop, seemingly entranced.       #pets100+30$$823$$0$0##&7$%p%##br# "Why does it... look so... delicious?" Time slows down to a crawl. Terrified for your#br#hypnotized companion, you attempt to rush forward and knock the plate from their#br#hands, but you can't seem to move fast enough. You watch helplessly as they bring#br#the plate to their lips and take a long, cool drink of its pestilential contents.   #pets100+30$$1$$0$0##&7$%p%##br# %p%'s body freezes, then ripples with an invisible energy that travels from the very#br# tips of their feet to the base of their skull. Slamming your fist into the plate, it goes#br# clattering to the ground, splaying gooey, brown spider guts, but it's too late. The deed#br# has been done, and the septic substance has already entered %p%'s bloodstream. #pets100+30$$501$$0$0##&7$%p%##br#"For... forgive me... %n%..." A single tear works its way out of %p%'s eye, and then a#br#bubbling, heaving foam erupts from their mouth like a mighty volcano, spraying#br#you in the face and covering you in thick, slimy goo. When the fountain finally ceases,#br#%p% drops to the ground, motionless. #pets100+30$$401$$0$0##&7$Omi##br#"How shocking! To think something I've cooked could have this amazing of a reaction!#br#That legendary cookware is some-thing else! HA! Can't wait to give it another go#br#with an equally as tantalizing recipe!   #M803010s100+30$Omi$824$$1$0##&7$%n%##br#As Omi gives himself an undeserving pat on the back, YOU rush over to your#br#companion's side to make sure they haven't actually died.

52010|In order to CATCH an Aqualord, you've got to THINK like an Aqualord, and that means understanding their every thought process.

"I have a feeling catching this bad boy will take a bit more research than simply dropping#br#
 your line in the water. First, we should try and analyze its eating habits, no? We figure#br#out what that thing likes to eat, and we figure just where that watering hole of his is,#br#so to speak."#M803010s100+30$Omi$831$$1$0#

#&7$Omi##br#
"Now, the wetlands here are—obviously—full of all sorts of different fish.#br#

#&7$Omi##br#
"This is just too weird. TOO WEIRD! I've never seen anything like this in my life!#br#

 the flames dance around its squirming body. "Would make cooking difficult, that's#br#

"You can't catch Phantom Fish with just any ol' fishing pole, you know? You need a#br#

#&7$Omi##br#
"One catch, though! Only the most talented of anglers can use this rod! And I'd dare#br#

52080|You've just caught yourself one of the rarest fish in the world—the Golden Phantom! Just as you're taking a closer look at it, Fate appears to give you the run-down on this phantom-like fish o' gold. It seems everything stems from a curse. And not just any curse... a phantom curse!

"One and the... same..." You and %p% turn around with spins so synchronized, the#br#

 one of the cursed... Phantom Fish... of legend..." Fate makes her way towards you,#br#
 apparently excited, but displaying nothing to give such emotions away. #M808010s100+30$Fate$301$$0$0#

#&7$Fate##br#
"This particular Phantom Fish... is known as the... Golden Phantom...#br#
 They're known to... only inhabit regions... close to the... Phantom Aqualord..."
     #M808010s100+30$Fate$831$$0$0#

"Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hold the phone here, Fate. Did you just say—and forgive#br# me if I'm wrong—'Phantom Aqualord?!?'" %p%'s bulbous eyes grow as round as#br# their plump little stomach. "Phantom Aqualord, Fate! To... to think such a thing#br#

 #pets100+30$$822$$1$0#

#&7$Fate##br#
"You heard... correctly... I did, indeed... say Phantom Aqualord...#br#
 Why do you look... so surprised... %p%?" Fate tilts her head to the side, eyes#br# even more vacuously inquisitive than usual. #M808010s100+30$Fate$831$$0$0#

#&7$Fate##br#
"Before you go... running off to try and catch it... I should tell you about... the clues..."#br#
 You and %p% lean in as Fate begins ambling back and forth, arms behind her back.#br# "In order to... locate the exact spot of... the Phantom Aqualord, you'll... need to gather#br#
 the... five-colored Phantom Fish in... one spot..."
 #M808010s100+30$Fate$831$$0$0#

#&7$Fate##br#
"Once you've collected... the five-colored Phantom Fish... legend has it that...#br#

"Quickly, you... must go collect... the five-colored Phantom Fish...#br#

52082|#&7$Fate##br#
"You haven't collected... nearly enough... Phantom Fish...#br#
 The miracle will... never occur at... this rate..." Fate's words are slow and#br#
 deliberate, and you can tell she's frustrated at your failure to do as asked. #M808010s100+30$Fate$831$$1$0#|
52083|#&7$Fate##br#
"This should be... plenty of... Phantom Fish..." While speaking, Fate procures a brown#br#
 canvas tote from seemingly nowhere, shaking it out to its full size. "You've done...#br# well..." She seems to be happy, but you can't quite tell for sure.
   #M808010s100+30$Fate$824$$1$0#

#&7$Fate##br#
"Simply put them... into this bag and... something unbelievable will... occur...#br#
 You might even call it a... miracle..." Fate shakes the bag in front of her, urging#br#
 you to place your recently caught Phantom Fish inside. #M808010s100+30$Fate$822$$1$0#|
52090|Just as you're thinking yourself the finest angler in the world, Omi comes along with a startling revelation—there just might be a NEW Aqualord skunking up the Stygian Peak region!

52100|Mholt has discovered a way to prevent split hairs and would like you to collect materials for the remedy.

"Well, you see... Ever since I arrived here, I've had this problem...#br# Just look for yourself what this inhospitably arid climate does to my hair!"#br#
 Mholt eyes the strands of hair on the ground.  The split ends seem rather serious. #M805010s100+30$Mholt$826$$1$0#

#&7$Mholt##br#
"Fortunately for me, there is a smattering of traveling merchants #br#

"...are a simple matter of hunting and gathering. Nothing to it! I've asked#br# the locals, and they assure me the formula is unrivaled at preventing #br#

   #M805010s100+30$Mholt$831$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You can hardly believe your eyes, but the formula clearly requires Whistwater Lurker Saliva...#br#

#&7$Eren##br#
"What's that? Oh! Of course! These are going to be a fine pair of oven mitts!  Can't you tell?#br#
 See, I was thinking the best kind of gift is a handcrafted gift. Silus is gonna love 'em!"#br#
 Eren is sewing together the fur and cloth in his hands. #M810010s100+30$Eren$4$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Oh... that really is... special.#br#
 This isn't your first time sewing, is it?"#br#
 %p% looks doubtfully at the mess in Eren's hands.#pets100+30$$821$$0$0#

#&7$Eren##br#
"Of course, it is! I'm just a natural.  That and I asked Karen to teach me how to sew..."#br#
 Eren states smugly.  #M810010s100+30$Eren$4$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Suddenly you get the feeling that someone is watching you from behind.#br#
 Turning, you see that Silus has been standing there for who knows how long.#char$$1$$0$0#

#&7$Eren##br#
"Ah! Silus! I have something for you! It's a thank you for how you've been looking after me.#br# It looks a little strange because it's my first time making it, but I think it should be good..."#br#
 Eren doesn't even manage to complete his sentence, long as it already was.
 #M810010s100+30$Eren$4$$1$0#

#&7$Silus##br#
 Silus silently takes the mitts and puts them on. #br# Then, quietly, he pats Eren on the shoulder. #M811010s100+30$Silus$831$$1$0#|

60010|Delphia suggests you introduce yourself to Master Craftsman Harris and get your hands on some new equipment.

"It warms my heart to witness the baptism of a new hunter and companion.#br#

#&7$Delphia##br#

 Do try not to be put off by his rather, hrm, churlish appearance. He's a very#br#

 Delphia slides a small envelope from her pouch and hands it to you. #M327090$Delphia$821$$1$0#

#&7$Delphia##br#
"Take this letter. Show it to him, and he'll get you fitted with a#br#

"Excellent, excellent. Always glad to help you young folk get your feet wet.#br#
 Here's a tip—the higher quality materials you bring me, the higher quality#br#

   #M802010s100+30$Qyubey$826$$0$0#|
60030|Delphia informs you that the mount vendor in town has recently received a new shipment of mounts. Given that you're itching to nab a mount of your very own, it seems in your best interest to get down there and check them out!|
60031|#&7$Delphia##br#
"%n%, have you perhaps noticed the mounts some of your fellow hunters use to get around?" #M327090$Delphia$4$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You respond that you have, indeed, taken notice of these mounts.#br#
 You'd also very much like to know where they come from#br#
 (as well as whether or not you can obtain one for yourself!).#char$$806$$0$0#

#&7$Delphia##br#
"They are quite adorable, aren't they? And quite essential, too, for a seasoned hunter.#br#
 I've recently heard tell that #&46$Mount Vendor Bruno#'s just received a new shipment of mounts.#br#
 You'll find him just #&46$south of the Falcon's Nest#.#br#
 Perhaps he'll have one or two you could take a look at?" #M327090$Delphia$821$51$1$0#|
60032|#&7$Delphia##br#
"There's no one more knowledgeable about mounts than our very own Bruno.#br#

 Definitely pay him a visit if you have the time." #M327090$Delphia$4$$1$0#|
60033|#&7$%n%##br#
 You return to Delphia after your talk with Bruno, informing her#br#
 somewhat dejectedly that he'd already sold the last of his new mount shipment.#char$$821$$0$0#

#&7$Delphia##br#
"Is that right? Such a pity. It seems everyone has their eye on a mount these days.#br#
 Still, you mustn't lose hope! I'm sure you'll find a mount of your own soon."
 Delphia reaches forward to take your hand between hers, offering you a warm smile. #M327090$Delphia$4$$1$0#

#&7$Strange Bird##br#
"Chiiiiiiirrup!"#br#
 A sudden, high-pitched noise interrupts the two of you, and you quickly#br#
 spin around to see what's the matter. #M004010s35+10$Strange Bird$4$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 What meets your gaze is the strangest, fluffiest creature you've ever laid eyes upon.#br#
 Taken aback by its appearance—and unsure as to its level of hostility—you quickly#br#
 raise your arms in defense.#char$$101$$0$0#

#&7$Strange Bird##br#
"Chirrup! Chirrup! Chiiiiiiiiirrup!"#br#
 The creature's eyes blink at you vacuously.#br#
 It reaches its beak forward and gives you a tiny peck on your knuckles. #M004010s35+10$Strange Bird$2$$1$0#

#&7$Delphia##br#
"Oh, my! If that isn't the most precious thing you ever SAW!"#br#
 Delphia saunters over to the bird-like creature and combs her fingers through the feathers on his head. #M327090$Delphia$2$51$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Seeing Delphia so calm, you feel quite silly standing with your dukes up.#br#
 You lower your fists and ask what in Sam Hill is going on.#char$$821$$0$0#

#&7$Delphia##br#
"Haven't you seen one of these before? They're called #&46$Beakises#. They're quite tame,#br#
 usually, and they make wonderful mounts. This one seems to have taken a liking to you, too!" #M327090$Delphia$4$51$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You're unsure how or why this 'Beakis' would be drawn to you (or what it was doing#br#
 wandering around Elysium in the first place!), but you admit, it IS pretty cute...#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Delphia##br#
"What do you think, %n%? You'd been hoping for a mount, after all.#br#
 Just consider him a gift from your neighborhood Falcons."#br#
 Delphia shoots you a little wink, and everything starts to come together#br#
 in your head. You respond with a smirk of your own. #M327090$Delphia$821$51$1$0#

#&7$Beakis##br#
"Chirrup! Chiiiiiiiirrup!"#br#
 The Beakis points his beak towards the sky with what sounds like high-pitched laughter.#br#
 Seems like he's pretty keen on the idea, as well. #M004010s35+10$Beakis$4$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You extend your hand and gently stroke the top of his head.#br#
 His feathers are soft and downy, and he nuzzles his beak against your shoulder.#br#
 You promise Delphia that you'll take good care of him.#char$$4$$0$0#|
60034|#&7$%n%##br#
 You're walking along the stone path when you hear what sounds like a quarrel in the distance.#br#
 Concerned, you quicken your pace, and soon find yourself looking at the very man you'd been seeking—#br#
 Mount Vendor Bruno! Unfortunately, it seems someone's beat you to the punch, and they#br#
 don't seem too happy...

#&7$Male Hunter##br#
"Whaddya MEAN you're already sold out?#br#
 I walked three nights and two days just to get here!#br#
 How'm I supposed to go back empty-handed?!" #M301010$Male Hunter$825$55$0$0#

#&7$Bruno##br#
"Look, buckaroo bonsai. What part of 'sold out,' don't you understand?#br#
 If they're gone, they're GONE! I can't magically manifest one out of my rear end!"#br#
 Bruno looks like he's about ready to lose his cool.
   #M308030$Bruno$826$$1$0#

#&7$Male Hunter##br#
"But I-... I... my village! We're in desperate need of mounts!#br#
 There's nowhere else I can get them, and I don't know when I'll be back#br#
 in Elysium again! You must understand! Isn't there anything...#br#
 ANYthing you can do?! There must be a way!" #M301010$Male Hunter$826$56$0$0#

#&7$Bruno##br#
"You're just too late! I'm not about to go make honest-paying customers return what their merchandise!#br#
 That being said, hmm... there ARE #&46$different ways of obtaining mounts#.#br#
 And you! You, over there! I assume you're here about mounts, too, yes? You should hear this, too."#br#
 Bruno's eyes turn sharply in your direction, and you take an instinctive step backwards. #M308030$Bruno$821$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Bruno beckons you over with a wave of his hand.#br#
 You're a bit taken aback—not thinking he'd noticed you—but you obey all the same.#br#
 You're not about to miss out on what could be juicy mount info!#char$$806$$0$0#

#&7$Bruno##br#
"All right, now, listen carefully, you too, 'cuz I ain't gonna be sayin' this twice.#br#
 Sure, you've got mount vendors like me who'll sell you a mount for a chunk of change,#br#
 but that's not the only way to go about nabbing one. You see, some #&46$Wild Dragomon# can#br#
 be tamed and turned into mounts as well. You've just gotta... shall we say, impress them?" #M308030$Bruno$821$$1$0#

#&7$Bruno##br#
"Heck, even some of the giant ones may decide to follow you if you show 'em who's boss!#br#
 You best one of those baddies, and they might #&46$leave something behind# that'll allow you
 to call on them when the going gets tough. Make sure you don't miss it!#br#
 Taming mounts on your own opens up a whole new world of mon husbandry. You oughta try it." #M308030$Bruno$824$51$1$0#

#&7$Male Hunter##br#
"B-but... you said... 'fight,' right? You have to fight the Dragomon first.#br#
 I'm... I'm not much of a fighter!" #M301010$Male Hunter$826$56$0$0#

#&7$Bruno##br#
"Whaaaaaat? And you call yourself a hunter?#br#
 Grow a pair, son! Chin up and fight like your mama gave you the right!#br#
 If you really wanna do something for your village, you'll find the guts. Trust me." #M308030$Bruno$825$55$1$0#

#&7$Male Hunter##br#
"A-... all right! All right, I'll do it!#br#
 I just need to, well... practice... a bit... yeah..."#br#
 The forlorn hunter slowly drags his feet away from Bruno.#br#
 You admit—you do feel sorry for the guy. Seems like there's a lot on his shoulders. #M301010$Male Hunter$821$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Once the man's well enough away, you turn back to Bruno.#br#
 Now that the two of you are alone, you can have a proper conversation!#br#
 You extend your hand to introduce yourself, but before you can so much as#br#
 make a peep, Bruno cuts you off.#char$$2$$0$0#

#&7$Bruno##br#
"I assume you're here about a mount as well, hm? I apologize about the wait,#br#
 though by now I'm sure you realize the situation I'm in." #M308030$Bruno$826$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You explain your situation to Bruno—about being one of the new Falcon recruits,#br#
 about being assigned to Agatha as a trainee, and about Delphia suggesting you#br#
 pay him a visit. To be honest, you're not sure why you tell him quite as much as you do,#br#
 but it does feel good to unload some of your pent-up emotions.#char$$821$$0$0#

#&7$Bruno##br#
"A newbie, huh? Excellent, excellent. Always nice to see some young blood running around.#br#
 I'm one of the best mount vendors around. Most of the ones I sell were originally caught#br#
 by hunters just like you! Unfortunately, they sell out like hotcakes, as you've seen for yourself." #M308030$Bruno$821$$1$0#

#&7$Bruno##br#
"It's just like with the last guy—there's really nothing I can do for you if I don't have any left.#br#
 Even if it IS at sweet Delphia's behest. So I apologize for not being able to help you out.#br#
 You could always go catch your own, though!"#br#
 Bruno shrugs his shoulders as if to reinforce his apology. #M308030$Bruno$826$56$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You wave your hands and tell him it's really no problem.#br#
 You'll let Delphia know back in the Falcon's Nest and simply try#br#
 again some other time. You bid him farewell before shoving off once more.#char$$821$$0$0#|
60040|Since you've already completed all of the league's available assignments, Angel suggests you pay his old hunting buddy, Darte, a visit. Seems like a decent enough way to pick up some quality advice about hunting, so why not?|
60041|#&7$Angel##br#
"Who is it, you ask? Why, an old hunting buddy of mine. A real-life Dragoon Cavalier.#br#
 This guy knows his stuff, let me tell you! And I heard that he just recently returned#br# to Elysium. I can't think of a better guy to give you a few tips about your first steps into#br#

#&7$Angel##br#
"Guy's name is Darte. Some of my fellow leaguers have mentioned seeing him#br#
 over in the #&46$northeastern part of town# training some of the other young guns.#br#
 Not sure what's he's doing back in town, but might as well take advantage of it, eh?" #M308060$Angel$1$$1$0#

#&7$Angel##br#
"Just let him know I sent you and you'll be right as rain! That fella'd do anything for me."#br#
 Angel gives you a rough description of his friend's appearance, then sends you#br#

 You're walking along the cobblestone path, your eyes peeled for any sign of this#br#
 "Darte" character, when you catch sight of someone who just so happens to match the#br#description Angel gave you. He's currently in some kind of heated debate with someone else.#char$$1$$0$0#

#&7$Darte##br#
 As you walk up, however, perhaps thanks in part to his heightened hunter's instincts, he seems#br#
 to sense your gaze. Breaking off his current conversation, he turns his head in your direction. #M330040$Darte$1$$1$0#

#&7$Darte##br#
"Well, well, well, what do we have here?"#br#
 Darte saunters over to your vantage point, a tiny smirk playing on his lips. #M330040$Darte$351$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#

 it was Chairman Angel who sent you to see him.#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Darte##br#
"Heh, that Angel... always DID know how to keep me busy.#br#
 Some things never change..."#br#
 Darte chuckles beneath his breath and crosses his arms in front of his chest. #M330040$Darte$2$$1$0#|
60050|Darte gives you some juicy info on rare Dragomon prowling about Crescent Beach. Head there yourself and test your mettle against these giant hulks!|
60051|#&7$Darte##br#
"So... you wanna learn about hunting, do you?"#br#
 Darte scratches his chin and gives you a thorough once-over. #M330040$Darte$4$$1$0#

"A new Falcon recruit, hm? They DO recruit them young, these days...#br#
 Seems like you can handle yourself just fine, though, if Angel's sent you to see me.#br#
 So why don't I learn you up a little on the most important part of hunting itself—#&46$Dragomon#."#br#
 Darte pulls you off to the side so you can talk in private. #M330040$Darte$821$$1$0#

#&7$Darte##br#
"There are some fine species of Dragomon out there, kid. Some rare ones, too.#br#
 Some of them have yet to even be discovered! It's our job as hunters to chronicle the#br#
 Dragomon we come across to create a comprehensive bestiary of all the world's species."#br#
 Darte slips a piece of paper out of his pocket, balancing it between his index and middle finger. #M330040$Darte$4$$1$0#

#&7$Darte##br#
"I just so happen to have obtained information, recently, about one such rare beastie. You#br#

 to becoming a hunter worth mentioning, hm?"#br#Darte slips the piece of paper into your pocket with a little pat. #M330040$Darte$4$$1$0#|
60052|#&7$Darte##br#
"The easiest way to get to the bay is via the gearcoptor in Elysium's airport just west of here.#br#
 You should keep from using the official Falcon gearcoptor for personal matters, yes?" #M330040$Darte$821$$1$0#|
60053|#&7$%n%##br#
 Still aglow from your earlier success, you show Darte the two pieces of the Abyssal Crab's#br#
 shell you picked up, giving him a blow-by-blow of what transpired in the bay.#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Darte##br#
"Seems you really do have some iron guts beneath that squishy exterior."#br#
 Darte laughs to himself, but he seems legitimately impressed.#br#
 "What say you and I take it to the next level then, hm?" #M330040$Darte$821$$1$0#|
60054|Defeat the Wingruses|
60060|Darte suggests you take the two pieces of crab shell you found over to Master Craftsman Harris.

It seems there's some kind of correlation between rare materials and rare gear... and Harris is just the one to learn you up on the birds and bees of crafting.|
60061|#&7$Darte##br#
"How 'bout I let you in a little secret most of us hunter folk have come to realize.#br#
 The best way to tell what kind of hunter you've got on your hands is by#br#
 looking at their equipment. 'It's in their gear,' you might say." #M330040$Darte$4$$1$0#

#&7$Darte##br#
"See, the reason I asked you to bring back this shell is twofold.#br#
 One? I, of course, wanted to see if you could take Mr. Crabby Pants down.#br#
 Two? I wanted to teach you a bit about #&46$crafting high-quality gear#." #M330040$Darte$826$$1$0#

#&7$Darte##br#
"You've already met with #&46$Master Craftsman Harris#, yes?#br#
 Why don't you take these two shell pieces to him? I have a feeling he'll be...#br#
 MOST interested." Darte gently taps your forehead with one of the shells#br#
 before dropping them in your hands. #M330040$Darte$822$$1$0#|
60062|#&7$Harris##br#
"Well, if it isn't my main mate, %n%! How's life treatin' you, kid?#br#
 Hadn't thought I'd be seeing you again so soon!" #M329020$Harris$821$51$1$0#|
60063|#&7$Harris##br#
"Well, if it isn't my main mate, %n%! How's life treatin' you, kid?#br#
 Hadn't thought I'd be seeing you again so soon!" #M329020$Harris$821$51$1$0#|
60070|Craftsman Harris goes over the nuts and bolts of refining to you. Looks like refining is an essential part of hunter life that you'll want to acquaint yourself with quickly!

You'll first need to collect some materials, though, so head on over to one of the bulletin boards and complete a few assignments to reap the rewards.|
60071|#&7$Harris##br#
"Ah! Right! Now I remember!#br#
 That’s right! wonders of #&46$refinement#!" #M329020$Harris$824$51$1$0#

#&7$Harris##br#
"A surefire way to give yourself the up-and-up when in the middle of a slugfest#br#
 is by refining your gear! Any hunter who's ANYbody knows how to take full advantage#br#
 of each piece of their equipment." You notice Harris giving your current gear a thorough#br#once-over with a click of his tongue. #M329020$Harris$4$$1$0#

#&7$Harris##br#
"Refining your gear boosts its stats. Each piece of equipment has a different #&46$bonus stat##br#
 depending on its original crafting process. You keep on refining that baby, and it'll continue to get#br#
 stronger and stronger until you max it out. It requires a lot of time, love, and deft hands, and you#br#
 might be wondering if it's all worth it, but hey—Elysium wasn't built in a night either, after all." #M329020$Harris$821$$1$0#

#&7$Harris##br#
"The other thing about refinement is that it requires #&46$different types of materials# depending#br#
 on the gear and type of refinement. The best way to go about resource collecting is by taking#br#
 on assignments from the Hunters' League. A lot of clients will give you materials as payment.#br#
 So whaddya say? Bring me back some materials? Then I'll show you the nitty-gritty stuff!"  #M329020$Harris$826$$1$0#|
60072|#&7$Harris##br#
"The more you refine your equipment, the more those bonuses will keep on stackin'!#br#
 It's a great way to turn duddy gear into GREAT gear! Heck, sometimes it's even better#br#than buying a whole new set!" #M329020$Harris$4$$1$0#|
60073|#&7$Harris##br#
"How'd it go, %n%? You collect some top-drawer materials yet?#br# Harris turns around with a smile as you approach.
   #M329020$Harris$4$51$1$0#

#&7$Harris##br#
"The more you refine your equipment, the more those bonuses will keep on stackin'!#br#
 All you've gotta do is bring me the materials, and I'll do the rest. So what are you waitin' for?#br#
 Get collectin'!"#br#
#br#
#&46$*Speak to Harris again and use the materials you obtained to refine your equipment. ##M329020$Harris$821$51$1$0#|
60080|There are so many different ways to get better equipment! You can craft it, refine it, and even evolve it!

In the midst of this mind-blowing revelation, Harris asks you to deliver a letter to Darte.|
60081|#&7$Harris##br#
"%n%, you little dune buggy! Back so soon? Is it thanks to my ravishing good looks? I can#br#
 see it in your eyes. You want... to learn about evolving your gear! I knew it! Well, let old#br#
 Harris learn you up right. You know crafting and refining, but do you recall the most famous#br#
 gear-strengthening process of all?" You're half-afraid Harris is about to break out into a song.
   #M329020$Harris$826$$1$0#

#&7$Harris##br#
"Unfortunately, I seem to have run fresh out of #&46$Evolution Scrolls#, which could#br#
 hinder the learning process a tad. I just so happen, however, to know a certain someone#br#
 who owes old Harris a bit of a favor, heheh." Harris whips out a piece of paper from his#br#
 breast pocket and begins hastily scrawling something down. #M329020$Harris$821$51$1$0#

#&7$Harris##br#
"Take this note to dearest Darte for me, would you? And let him know that#br#
 I'd be happy to waive the refining fee he still owes me from our last order of business#br#
 if he would so kindly follow the instructions I've written here."#br#
 Harris hands you the scrap of paper, and you slip it into your pocket for safekeeping. #M329020$Harris$4$$1$0#|
60082|#&7$Darte##br#
"..."#M330040$Darte$1$$1$0#|
60083|#&7$%n%##br#
 You approach Darte and his now-familiar group of protégés by the stairs. He notices you as#br#
 you walk up, eyebrow raised in curious inquisition as he accepts the note from Harris. #char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Darte##br#
"Not sure it was necessary for Harris to go and blab about our personal business#br#
 matters to someone like you..." The irritation is evident in Darte's voice as he peruses#br#
 the note. #M330040$Darte$826$$1$0#

#&7$Darte##br#
"Then again, maybe this isn't such a bad deal after all! One Evolution Scroll? That's all?#br# HA! You're really saving me a bundle, my little hunter chickadee. Go ahead, go ahead!#br#
 One #&46$Evolution Scroll#. I give it to you gladly!" Darte drops the rolled-up#br#
 parchment into your hand with a smug grin, still laughing to himself.
   #M330040$Darte$824$51$1$0#|
60090|Darte has done the courtesy of recognizing you as a proper Dragomon hunter. Head on back to Angel to boast! Erm, to improve your hunting skill!|
60091|#&7$Darte##br#
"Seems everyone around here thinks you're some kind of up-and-coming hot-shot, yes?#br#
 And me? Well, I've no reason to doubt Harris and Angel. Sure, we may get into an... altercation#br#or two, but when it comes down to it, I'd trust both those gents with my life."#br#
 Darte grips your shoulder in his wide palm and gives you an amiable shake. #M330040$Darte$821$$1$0#

#&7$Darte##br#
"The road to being a great hunter isn't paved with gold, and you'll find yourself wandering#br#
 the beaten paths alongside it more often than not. If you keep your head up, though, and don't#br#
 let one or two failures get you down, you'll find your way through the maze eventually." #M330040$Darte$822$$1$0#

#&7$Darte##br#
"Maybe even someday, you'll earn yourself the rank of Dragoon Cavalier, just like me.#br#
 Well... someday in the far, far, far future, yes?" He shoots you a playful wink.#br# "Anyway, it's about time you head back and see if Angel needs anything else, don't you think?" #M330040$Darte$4$$1$0#|
60092|#&7$Angel##br#
"Oh, Vivian... If only you could see how much you mean to me..."#br#
 Angel gazes longingly towards the bulletin board where Vivian is cheerily greeting other hunters. #M308060$Angel$821$54$1$0#|
60093|#&7$Angel##br#
"Ah, %n%! You're back! Perfect timing.#br#
 Old Darte didn't give you too much of a hard time, did he?#br#
 Guy always could be a bit of a handful."#br#Angel gives you a cordial slap on the back. #M308060$Angel$4$$1$0#

#&7$Angel##br#
"And would you look at you! Glowin' like you're made of starfire, you are!#br#
 I knew sending you to see him would do you good." #M308060$Angel$821$$1$0#|
60100|Despite Van Pelt acting like a socially inept boy asking his crush to prom, he pulls through in the end and offers to have that Dragocite of yours refined for free! What luck! Seems it's not the speediest process, though, so he suggests you take on a few assignments before heading over to see Harris.|
60101|#&7$Delphia##br#
"%n%! Oh, %n%! Wait just a moment, would you?#br# Our exalted leader has something he'd like to speak with you about..."#br#
 Delphia smiles impishly before glancing to her left—to where#br#Van Pelt is peeping out through a nearby bush. #M327090$Delphia$4$$1$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"What? You weren't supposed to—!! I mean... heeeey, %n%! How's it dragon? Erm, HANGIN'!#br# Thought I'd come, you know, check up on you like a properly wyverned—conCERNED#br#
 leader and all. You know, after that whole, crazy hunt with the giant, man-eating#br#
 lizard. You doin' OK? No creepy reptiles infesting your dreams? Horrifying hallucinations? PTSD?"#br#
   #M330090$Van Pelt$826$56$0$0#

#&7$Delphia##br#
Delphia sighs and rolls her eyes—an unusual gesture coming from her.#br#
 "Can you talk like a proper, socialized human being, Van? I'm fairly certain #br#
 %n% is not going to scream if you say the word 'wyvern.' If anything, it's#br#
 your bizarre idiosyncrasies that are going to scare them off!"#br#
 Delphia crosses her arms in front of her chest as Van Pelt chuckles awkwardly. #M327090$Delphia$824$51$1$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"It's just, well, after we got back, I was suddenly afraid maybe we'd traumatized the#br#
 kid! You know, rushing them into life-threatening situations too quickly and all.#br#
 I don't wanna run off our most promising recruit! Which is why I was thinking of doing#br#
 them the favor of having that Dragocite processed... free of charge!" #M330090$Van Pelt$821$51$0$0#

#&7$Delphia##br#
"Oh, WERE you? And did you get this approved with the order treasury, hm? Last I checked, we#br#
 didn't have any spare funds thanks to a certain someone going overboard at last month's#br#
 Falcon Banquet. Oh, %n%, you should have SEEN him! He got up on one of the tables#br#
 and started—" Pelt shoves a handful of gold coins into Delphia's hands, face stricken#br#with unadulterated horror. #M327090$Delphia$824$51$1$0#

#&7$Van Pelt##br#
"AHAHA! Let's not traumatize the child anymore than we already have, right? DELPHIA?#br#
 %n%, why don't you go take on some assignments over at the Hunters' League?#br#
 Delphia and I need to speak privately, so if you could go and do, er... #&46$eight or so...##br#
 that would be great. Afterwards, you can go see Harris and show him your new Dragocite." #M330090$Van Pelt$4$$0$0#|
60102|#&7$Harris##br#
"Well, if it isn't %n%!#br# How's life treatin' ya?#br#
 Heard you just came back from a hunt, yeah?" #M329020$Harris$4$51$1$0#|
60103|#&7$%n%##br#
 As soon as you approach Harris's smithy, his eyes light up, and he#br#escapes inside for a moment before returning with a small box. #M329020$Harris$2$$1$0#

#&7$Harris##br#
"I know exACTLY why you're here, %n%! Take a peep at that piece of#br#
 #&46$Dragocite# you collected. Now that's what I call a high-quality spit-shine!#br#
 Ain't nobody around who can refine that stuff like me!" #M329020$Harris$821$51$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Eyes full of wonder, you slowly open the box to reveal the most radiant,#br#
 gleaming piece of smoothly-polished Dragocite you've ever seen.#br#
 You don't even recognize it as the same rocky chunk from earlier!#char$$4$$0$0#

#&7$Harris##br#
"Dragocite is the most powerful stuff around. It can enhance your abilities ten, twentyfold!#br#
 Certain types of Dragocite can even grant a hunter extraordinary powers. Did you ever wanna be#br#
 able to spew crazy-wild Dragomon fire from your hand? Well! This Dragocite won't let you do that!#br#
 But some can. It takes an incredibly skilled hunter to be able to utilize that power, though." #M329020$Harris$826$$1$0#

#&7$Harris##br#
"The one thing you've gotta remember about Dragocite is this—the #&46$innate effects of a certain##br#
 #&46$piece of Dragocite can't be changed#... BUT! If you bring it to me, I can, let's say, 'tweak' it a little#br#
 to #&46$manipulate those effects# in ways that'll better benefit you, the hunter." #M329020$Harris$4$$1$0#

#&7$Harris##br#
"Now, all of that comes with a price on its head, of course, because as much as I like ya,#br#
 I ain't no charity! You'll need to fetch me the #&46$proper materials# for the type of transformation#br#
 you'd like. But I highly recommend you do, if you're serious about becoming a big-name hunter."#br#
#br#
#&46$*Speak with Harris again to open up the Dragocite Transformation interface. ##M329020$Harris$824$51$1$0#|
60110|Return to the Falcon's Nest and prepare for the next challenge!|
60111|#&7$Harris##br#
"If you've ever got any questions about Dragocite or transformation#br#
 or crafting or, well, you know, anything up that alley, you know where#br#
 to find me! No need to be stressed when you've got the best"#br#
 Harris slaps his chest proudly. #M329020$Harris$4$$1$0#

#&7$Harris##br#
"Now then, if you wouldn't mind, I've got myself a pretty steep order of#br#
 weapons to fill. Unless you wanna fulfill your true calling as a blacksmith, I'd#br#
 say you should get that keister of yours back to HQ!"#br# Harris gives said keister a smack to usher you on your way before returning to his anvil.
   #M329020$Harris$821$51$1$0#|
60112|#&7$Delphia##br#
"Good day, %n%." #M327090$Delphia$822$51$1$0#|
60113|#&7$Delphia##br#
"Ah, %n%! You're back.#br#
 Did Harris teach you the basics behind Dragocite?"#br#
 Delphia cocks her head to the side in inquisition upon your return. #M327090$Delphia$822$51$1$0#

#&7$Delphia##br#
"It may seem like a lot to take in all at once, but as you familiarize yourself#br#
 with the various aspects of hunter-hood, it will quickly feel like old hat."#br#
 She gives your head an encouraging pat along with one of her winning smiles. #M327090$Delphia$821$$1$0#|
60120|Just what's this event Agatha's talking about? And is it really as frightening as she's made it out to be?

No choice now but to hop aboard the nearby gearcopter and meet her there...|
60121|#&7$Agatha##br#
"All right, enough slackin'.#br#
 Let's get a move on, %n%."#br#
 Agatha gives her head a shake to smooth down her hair. #M320090$Agatha$821$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You're not entirely sure where you're getting a move on to,#br#
 but you're also not entirely sure if asking her would warrant you#br#
 another bout of belittlement.#char$$806$$0$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"What's with the blank face? Don't tell me you haven't heard!"#br#
 Agatha's looks of exasperated amazement are becoming all too common. #M320090$Agatha$4$55$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You sheepishly inform her that you're not aware of anything else that needs doing.#br#
 Agatha's eyes narrow, and you can feel your heart dropping into your gut.#char$$826$$0$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"You really are—... oh! Wait. That's right.#br#
 You weren't herded in with all the other noobs, so you didn't#br#
 hear their whole introductory spiel."#br#
 Agatha scratches at her chin in thought. #M320090$Agatha$825$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You're glad this lapse in understanding is due to no fault of your own.#br#You ask Agatha what it entailed.#char$$821$$0$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"It's the same every year. After all you rooks are inducted and what-not,#br#
 the higher-ups hold a #&46$big event#, as it were, to, erm, how do I put it?#br#
 Acquaint the newbies with what's to come?" #M320090$Agatha$821$51$1$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"Being part of the famous Falcons isn't all cotton candy, hearts, and rainbows,#br#
 after all, so we've gotta ease you noobs in as easily as we can.#br#
 Well, at least, that's what people like Pelt and Delphia think."#br#
 Agatha seems to be skirting around something, but you're not sure what. #M320090$Agatha$4$$1$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"That being said, there ARE always a few lily-livered rooks who end up pissing their#br#
 pants and running off to their mamas as soon as the soiree's over and done.#br# I trust you won't be one of them?" The corners of Agatha's mouth curl upwards#br#
 in an impish smile. #M320090$Agatha$824$51$1$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"The #&46$gearcopter# just over yonder will take you to the venue once you're ready.#br#
 Change into your big-kid pants if you need to!" #M320090$Agatha$4$$1$0#|

60123|#&7$Agatha##br#
"Ahh... feels good to bust some heads! That's what being a hunter's all about, yeah?#br#
 Kickin' butt and takin' names. Not training a bunch of hapless rooks."#br#
 You don't miss the disdain smoldering in the look she flashes your way. #M320090$Agatha$2$54$1$0#|

60130|Just as you're anxious to get back in the groove of things in the Falcon's Nest, Delphia procures a letter from Darte of all people! It seems the somewhat spoony bard—erm, dragoon!—needs you, but for what, you're uncertain. Despite Agatha's evident distaste regarding the matter, you really should see what he needs.

It could be important! ...well, it COULD...|
60131|#&7$Delphia##br#
"Wait a minute, Agatha. It seems you're not the only one desperately seeking %n%.#br# They've got a few admirers of their own." Delphia brings a hand to her mouth in laughter.#br#
 "Seems it's from our dear friend Darte. He wants to report to him as SOON as possible."#br#
 Delphia places the letter in your hand with a knowing smile. #M327090$Delphia$4$$1$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"Darte? Oh, THIS'LL be good. I swear, that Casanova is always up to something.#br# You should watch your back around him, %n%. I've seen too many good hunters#br#
 get taken in by his adulation! Don't let him take advantage of you!"#br#
 Agatha snatches the letter from your hand and begins scrutinizing its contents. #M320090$Agatha$4$$0$0#

#&7$Delphia##br#
"Oh, Agatha! Darte is a brilliant hunter! Denigration is a bad color on you. The letter#br#
 seems innocent enough—something about a... #&46$primordial Dragomon# of some sort. You#br#
 know—typical Darte! Perhaps %n% has simply caught his eye and he'd like their#br#
 assistance! %n% has been catching many people's eyes these days, after all." #M327090$Delphia$821$$1$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"Well. Whatever. Just make sure you've got eyes in the back of your head.#br#
 Nothing good ever seems to come from dealing with that blighted dragoon.."#br#
 Agatha's arms cross in front of her chest as her nose curls upwards disdainfully.#br# "What're you waiting for, then? Your knight's waiting, %n%! Get goin'!"
     #M320090$Agatha$821$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You're surprised at Agatha's readily-apparent hostility towards Darte. Sure, he can#br#
 be a bit of a braggart—and questionably touchy, at times—but he's always seemed#br#
 amiable enough to you! He's even let you in on a few hunters' secrets! At any rate, you#br#should go see just what it is he needs!#char$$801$$1$0#|

"Just the hunter I've been wanting to see! It's been a while, %n%.#br# Life been treating you well? You certainly seem to have grown since#br#
 we've last talked." Darte looks you up and down, his shrewd eyes not #br# missing one detail. You see his lips curl upwards in satisfaction.
    
     #M330040$Darte$4$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Feeling rather proud, but also a little puzzled, you're just about to#br#
 ask the husky hunter why he summoned you, when he pulls a small#br#
 but beautifully carved horn from his pouch and blows into it.#br#
 Surprisingly, though, the horn makes no sound. You blink in confusion.#char$$806$$0$0#

#&7$Darte##br#
"All right. NOW... we're ready. I must warn you, %n%. You must never show or#br#
 speak to anybody of the place we're about to go... if you value their life, that is." You#br#
 don't miss the somewhat sadistic glint in Darte's eyes. "Meet me at the spot marked on#br#
 this map, but DO be quick? My companion doesn't like to wait long..."    
   #M330040$Darte$821$$1$0#

#&7$Darte##br#
Darte hands you a rolled-up piece of parchment before turning on his heels with a#br#
 flick of his cape. "Oh, and if there's anyone special in your life, you might want to pay#br#
 them a visit before you come. You know—just in case..." You hear him chuckle to himself#br#
 as he walks off, disappearing into the crowd like dust in the wind... #M330040$Darte$826$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Now you're even MORE confused (and—admittedly—a bit afraid for your life!).#br#
 You glance down at %p%, who seems just as perplexed, their head still tilted in#br#
 vacuous confusion. You snap your fingers in front of their face, and they suddenly#br#jump backwards in surprise.#char$$826$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"%n%! You almost gave me a heart-attack! B-but more importantly, did you hear#br#
 that noise just now? It sounded like... like... well, like the howl of some gigantic creature!#br#
 And not a friendly one, either. M-maybe it was just my imagination! It's amazing#br#
 what crazy tricks acoustics can play on you..." #pets100+30$%p%$3$$1$0#|
60140|Darte—mysterious as ever—hands you a map and tells you to meet him at Echo Mountain, but why? You don't even have a chance to ask before he leaves without a word. Looks like you've got no choice but to head to the mountain yourself and see just what this nonsense is all about!

Set your sights on Echo Mountain and put the mystery to rest!|
60141|#&7$%p%##br#
"We shouldn't keep Darte waiting, you know? I don't know what it is, but something#br#

 What could be in Echo Mountain that's so special?#char$$826$$0$0#|

"..."#M330040$Darte$1$$1$0#|
60143|#&7$Darte##br#
"Ah! There you are, %n%! Took your sweet time, did you? I've already finished#br#
 dealing with Epion and everything! A crying shame, really, that I was hired to catch it#br#
 alive... The Dragocite I could have harvested from it is worth its weight in gold.#br#
 Ah well, these things are sent to try us." Darte tsk's in the back of his throat.   #M330040$Darte$826$$1$0#

#&7$Darte##br#
"Nevertheless, think of this as a dry run, yes? We had much higher hopes involved#br#
 in this hunt than mere Dragocite. Which reminds me, there was one more thing I'd#br#
 like to discuss with you—a matter of secrecy, if you will." Darte slowly strokes his#br#
 scruff, as inscrutable as always. #M330040$Darte$4$$1$0#|
60144|#&7$Darte##br#
"The look on your FACE! Absolutely priceless! Didn't piss your pants, did you, kiddo?#br# Wouldn't want to have to make a pit-stop to change your skivvies. I'll admit, when my#br#
 darling Nepythnia gets worked up, even I can't hold her back. You should be thankful she#br#
 didn't swallow you whole!" Darte laughs as though such a notion would be downright droll.
   #M330040$Darte$824$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"M-M-Mr. Darte, sir, I-... I mean... who is... how is...#br#
 WHAT'S GOING ON?!" %p%'s eyes have practically rolled#br#
 back in their head at the sudden shock of this giant dragon#br#holding their companion captive.#pets100+30$$823$$0$0#

#&7$Darte##br#
"Oh, WHERE are my manners? Shall I introduce you? This lovely lady is none other#br#
 than my companion #&46$Nepythnia, the Frozen Monarch #. Fabulous, isn't she?#br#
 Now then, my dearest Nepythnia, this is %n%. I told you about them, didn't I?#br# The two of you are going to be working OH-so-well together on this assignment..."
   #M330040$Darte$821$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Everything's happening so fast! It's all a bit much for you to take in.#br#
 Work together? Assignment? What's all this nonsense?! Darte had better#br#
 start explaining things... and QUICK! 
 #char$$821$$0$0#

#&7$Darte##br#
"Oh? No one told you? And here I thought you'd been made aware! I was#br# hoping you'd accompany me in hunting down a recently awakened primordial#br#
 Dragomon—the voracious, implacable #&46$Epion, the Calamity Wing#!#br#
 Darte walks in front of you, gently stroking the underside of Nepythnia's long neck.
   #M330040$Darte$821$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 The gigantic white Dragomon snorts, though you're unsure if the snort is in response to#br#
 Darte's comment or his touch. The ground beneath its snout instantly turns white with#br#
 frost. It's easy to see where the title "Frozen Monarch" came from...#char$$823$$0$0#

#&7$Darte##br#
"Of course, I could catch it on my own easily enough, but being the encouraging mentor#br#
 I am, I thought the experience would be inVALUable to a fledging hunter such as yourself.#br#
 It'll also help you acclimatize to riding a Dragomon, yes? I can imagine you haven't had#br#
 many opportunities to do so. You may thank me later in whatever way you feel appropriate." #M330040$Darte$824$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You're going to hunt a Dragomon... on top of aNOTHER Dragomon?! You admit, for#br#
 as many wild stories as you'd imagined in your head of what hunter life would be#br#
 like, you'd never imagined this! You attempt to make yourself more comfortable#br#
 atop Nepythnia, who consequently utters a howl that harrows your very soul.#char$$823$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"That sound! That's what I heard back in Elysium!" All of a sudden,#br# another howl—deeper, even, than Nepythnia's—echoes up from the#br#
 valley floor. %p% scuttles towards a nearby bush and attempts to hide#br#
beneath a rock. "Wh-wh-wh-what was THAT?!"
 #pets100+30$825$$1$0#

#&7$Darte##br#
"Sounds like we've woken Sleeping Beauty. Time to get moving along, then, yes?#br# Enjoy the show, if you can, %n%! It's not often you get a front-row seat to a brutal#br#
 Dragon-on-Dragon tussle. Just... try not to get any of your limbs between their teeth.#br#
 Unless you fancy a fancy new prosthetic taking its place..."
   #M330040$Darte$4$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Just as you are about to utter some not very choice words as to your thoughts on this#br#
 whole affair, Nepythnia dashes forward, and you have to grapple at the spines on her#br#
 back to keep from flying off onto the dirt below. The wind sends your hair whirling#br# about your face, and you struggle to see as you charge up the side of the mountain. 
 #char$$807$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"%n%! %n%, where are you going?! Don't leave me behiiiiiiiind!"#br#
 You can just barely hear %p%'s voice squeaking behind you as they#br#struggle to keep up.
 #pets100+30$$303$$1$0#|
60145|#&7$Darte##br#
"Lovely. Lovely, lovely." Darte sheathes his sword with a#br#
 satisfied smile, sauntering over towards you and Nepythnia. #M330040$Darte$826$$1$0#

#&7$Darte##br#
"Why the look of shock, %n%? Surely, you'd expect an experienced Dragoon Cavalier#br# such as myself would be proficient in ALL types of combat, yes? If you can handle#br#
 one weapon, you should be able to handle them ALL, wouldn't you think? No need to#br#
 make such a big show of it... though I'll be happy to accept your undying devotion all week."
   #M330040$Darte$821$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 TWO weapons? You can barely handle ONE weapon! Especially well enough to take down#br#
 a giant dragon! You're not even sure Agatha could so deftly wield two vastly different weapons.#br#
 You feel a burning desire to ask Darte how he does it, but you're unsure if such a question#br#
 would be prying too much into his personal affairs, so you refrain from asking.#char$$821$$0$0#

#&7$Darte##br#
"I can read you like a book, you know. There's no reason to be shy. It's what I#br# was planning on teaching you through this whole affair anyway! Really, why#br#
 would I have wasted so much effort switching weapons in the middle of battle#br#
 like that unless I had a point to make, hm?" Darte raises an eyebrow knowingly.
   #M330040$Darte$4$$1$0#

#&7$Darte##br#
"I won't sugarcoat it—becoming this proficient takes... practice. You must relearn everything#br#
 you've already learnt with one weapon using another. Like starting from scratch, but you#br#
 seem quite capable, already, with your current weapon, so I wonder if it wouldn't do you#br#
 good to begin training with a secondary." Darte pats the butt of your weapon with a laugh. #M330040$Darte$821$$1$0#

#&7$Darte##br#
"Dragomon each have their own weak points, and certain weapons are more efficient at#br#
 taking advantage of these weak points. Being able to swiftly switch out your weapon for#br#
 a more effective weapon will allow you to take command of the battlefield in ways you've#br#
 never imagined. It takes an extraordinary amount of time and effort, but the payoff is great." #M330040$Darte$4$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 The more Darte explains, the wider your eyes grow, your mind overwhelmed with this#br#
 awe-inspiring prospect. An image of you flawlessly flaunting two weapons fills your head,#br#
 blocking out everything still spewing from Darte's mouth. All of a sudden, you realize#br#
 he's awaiting some sort of a response, and you quickly nod, hoping the answer was yes.#char$$824$$0$0#

#&7$Darte##br#
"Wonderful. It seems I've made the right choice, then, hm? Think hard on what I've#br#
 just taught you and make your decision. In the meantime, head on back to Elysium.#br#
 I've still got to... figure out how I'm going to ship off this big lugabug." Darte sighs,#br#
 looking over at the dragon speculatively, as though assessing crate sizes. #M330040$Darte$824$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You bid Darte farewell—and thank him for the information—then turn on your heels#br#
 to return to the gearcopter. Nepythnia, in turn, quietly nods at you, a wry gleam in#br#
 her eye. Just as you're beginning to wonder where %p% slipped off to, you notice them#br#sliding off the white Dragomon's back with a little wave.
 #char$$801$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Wait up, %n%! Sorry about that. Was just having a little chat with Nepythnia! Oh, %n%. You wouldn't beLIEVE the stories she has! Like, like... Darte?#br#
 Oh, my god, you've gotta hear this!" All of a sudden, %p% brings their paws to their#br#
 mouth, eyes wide. "Whoops! I promised I wouldn't tell. Sorry! I'm sure you understand..."
 #pets100+30$$824$$1$0#|
60146|Darte wants you to bring down the awakened primordial Dragomon, Epion the Calamity Wing. This is no time for dilly-dallying... or shilly-shallying, for that matter! Charge forward atop Nepythnia!

Climb the mountain to Epion's lair and take that draconic devil down!|
60150|Darte demonstrates a perfect display of how to switch weapons mid-combat in a blinding flurry of steel. Thinking such a skill would be a mighty fine addition to your own collection, your head fills with all kinds of glorious fantasies... now if only you could figure out how to do it yourself! Perhaps Agatha could give you a word of advice or two?

Certainly couldn't hurt to try...|
60151|#&7$Darte##br#
"I'll have to ask you to keep what's happened here... just between us. I can only imagine#br#
 the looks I'd get from Delphia and Van if they heard I was carting off young hunters#br#
 into dragons' dens! Quite the humorous mental image, but one I'd like to avoid. So...#br#
 we'll keep it our little secret, hm?" Darte smiles, his face dripping with saccharine expectancy.#M330040$Darte$821$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"But, but, but... what about Nepythnia and I, huh? What about us?"#br#
 %p% suddenly exclaims, bounding over.#pets100+30$%p%$822$$0$0#

#&7$Darte##br#
"You two? I wasn't exactly... worried about you two, but I suppose if you'd like to be#br#
 included, all the more to you. EVERYone can keep their traps shut!" Darte laughs to#br#
 himself. "As for you, %n%, keep up your training, and remember what I told you.#br# You're capable of great things. You've just got to learn to unleash them."
   #M330040$Darte$824$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 After a hearty pat on the back from Darte that nearly sends you to the ground,#br#
 you bid him farewell, excited to run off and test out this new skill you've learned.#br#
 Unfortunately, you're not exactly sure how to START... Hmm, perhaps Agatha might#br#
 have some insight into all of this? Seems like a good enough place to start. #char$$801$$0$0#|
60152|#&7$Agatha##br#
"..."#M320090$Agatha$1$$0$0#|
60153|#&7$Agatha##br#
"Oh? %n%! Back already? And you haven't lost any limbs, either!#br#
 Surprising, surprising..." Agatha's voice drips with sarcasm.
   #M320090$Agatha$821$$1$0#

#&7$Delphia##br#
"Ah, %n%! Welcome back! And how was darling Darte? No problems, I assume?#br#
 Remember, dear, you can always come to us if you're in need of assistance.#br#
 Consider this your safe haven!" Delphia's eyes crinkle in encouraging consolation.
   #M327090$Delphia$4$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 At the sudden onslaught of questions, you almost forget your promise to Darte and#br#
 start blabbing about your conquest of the giant dragon. Just in time, however, you#br#
 bite your tongue. In a rush to come up with something believable, you simply shrug#br#
 and say he wanted your help with a wryly Beastomon. It's not exactly a LIE... is it?  

#&7$Agatha##br#
"Huh. And here I would've thought Darte more capable than that.#br#
 Coming to you, of all people, about something so trivial." Agatha's#br#
 eyes narrow as she scrutinizes your suddenly hunched frame. #M320090$Agatha$821$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You should have known Agatha wouldn't simply accept something like that without#br#
 question! Quickly trying to change the subject, you ask her #&46$whether it's possible to swap##br# 
 #&46$weapons during# combat. As Agatha blinks her eyes in surprise, you breathe#br#
 a sigh of relief, knowing you've successfully diverted her attention... for now.#char$$826$$0$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"Swap weapons? You move fast, rook. Already looking at switch-hitting? Who#br#
 put THAT crazy idea in your head, I wonder." She rubs at her chin. "Hmm...#br#
 true, it may be a little early, but you HAVE shown your fair share of skill.#br#
 I suppose it wouldn't be entirely out of line to start you on a secondary weapon..." #M320090$Agatha$4$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Oh? So Agatha DOES know about this certain skill set...#br#
 You wonder, then, why she doesn't make use of it herself.#br#
 Surely, as great a hunter as she is, she'd...#char$$801$$0$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
Agatha shrugs her shoulders, and you realize you'd voiced your concerns out loud.#br#
 "No real reason, I guess. I just like my blades better. Sure, I went through a rifle phase—who#br#
 doesn't, after all?—but it was so LOUD! And all that GUNpowder! Meh. Just wasn't my#br# thing. Figured I'd concentrate on my blades, instead." She pats said weapons of mass destruction.
   #M320090$Agatha$826$$1$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"Don't let that deter you if that's the direction you wanna go, though. I mean, tons of hunters#br#
 enjoy the old switcharoo! Like Delphia, for instance. Look at her, all innocent with that#br# staff of hers, but get on her bad side? Heh. There's a reason the cestus is known as the#br#
 most brutal weapon of them all." Agatha's eyes flash with a sadistic glimmer of excitement.
   #M320090$Agatha$824$$1$0#

#&7$Delphia##br#
"Oh, Agatha! Look at you—going on again! Really, I'm not that vicious!#br# I simply like to keep myself limber! And what better way than a few training#br#
 sessions with my cestuses? It's not at all that I enjoy the sight of fresh blood..."#br# Delphia giggles in embarrassment. You, however, take a step backwards.
  
   #M327090$Delphia$824$51$0$0#

#&7$Agatha##br#
"Anyway, what it really comes down to is practice! Lots and LOTS of practice. No matter#br#
 what weapon you use—or how many, for that matter—it needs to be an extension of#br#
 yourself. Using it should be second nature, and if you feel you can get to that point with#br#
 two weapons, then all the more to you. You just have to be prepared to put in the effort."  #M320090$Agatha$821$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 All of this seems like an awful lot to take in, and there seem to be any number of#br#
 factors to consider. Maybe this won't be as easy a decision as you initially thought!#br#
 What'll it be, then? Should you #&46$continue to concentrate on your current weapon?##br#
 Or #&46$divide your time training with a secondary weapon?##char$$806$$0$0#|

 corpses already burning traumatizing mental images in your mind. Flinging your#br#arms out to your either side, you beg them to reconsider.#char$$807$$0$0#

#&7$Simón##br#
"%n%! This business does not concern you. The chairman and I have, how shall you#br#
 say, a cuenta pendiente, yes? Go to the Hoppadrome and prepare for the tournament!"#br# Simón and Angel stare each other down, hackles raised.#br#
 Simón's hand slips inside his jacket. Angel's hand goes for the box.
   #M825010s100+30$Simón$101$$1$0#

#&7$Angel##br#
"Die, rebel scum! BWAHAHA!"#br# Angel whips out a toy crossbow, letting fly one of its tiny arrows. The arrow#br# hits Simón right between the eyes, bouncing off and onto the ground.#br# "Dead! You're dead, dead, dead, dead, DEAD! Down on the ground, gazpacho!"
  
   #M308060$Angel$601$$0$0#

#&7$Simón##br#
"¡Qué balurdo! %n% was standing in my way! That one did not count!#br#
 %n%, meet me at the Lapitaro Lodge later! I will have to...#br#
 deal with this achanto first, ohoho. This time it is for real, Angel!#br# Do not let me see you with your tail between your piernas!"
       #M825010s100+30$Simón$823$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You have no idea what's going on here, but at least it seems they aren't going#br#
 to murder each other anymore. Another Hoppadrome tournament, though?#br#You'd better get ready! Go find Simón back at the #&46$Lapitaro Lodge# once you're all set.#char$$826$$0$0#|
60172|#&7$Angel##br#
"Get going, kid. These matters don't concern you..."#br# Angel's body is rigid as he glares daggers at Simón.
    #M308060$Angel$101$$1$0#|
60173|#&7$Angel##br#
"So, how did things go over at the Hoppadrome? Give 'em heck?#br#
 I wouldn't expect any less of ya, ahaha!"#br#
 Angel slaps you on the back, in a seemingly fantastic mood. #M308060$Angel$824$$1$0#

#&7$Angel##br#
"By the way, I've finally gotten word back from our alchemist friends!#br#
 What'd I tell you, huh? Old Angel would pull through! I'm just glad#br#
 all those wingdings I scribbled didn't offend them somehow.#br#
 Wouldn't THAT have been a kick in the shorts!" #M308060$Angel$4$$1$0#|
60174|#&7$Simón##br#
 As you approach Simón, you notice the despondent droop of his ears, the#br#
 spiritless twitch of his nose—he must have lost his duel with Angel. #M825010s100+30$Simón$827$$1$0#

#&7$Simón##br#
"Oh... it is you, %n%. Lo siento, but I do not have a Hoppadrome ticket #br#
 for you this time. Instead, you should have received one while completing #br#
 assignments for the league, no?" #M825010s100+30$Simón$831$$1$0#

#&7$Simón##br#
"The rule are the same as before. You should... go and divertirse, yes?#br# Please just leave me in peace. Simón needs time some time to his self..."#br#
 You notice a small crossbow lying in splinters on the ground. As you walk away#br#
 you hear Simón sigh despairingly. "A cada cochino le llega su Sábado..." #M825010s100+30$Simón$826$$1$0#|
60180|The far-distant sound of applause, the roar of the crowd baying for blood... your blood! It's time for the Hunter's Hoppadrome!

Best head on over to the Lapitaro Lodge and sign yourself up for the next tournament! Just be sure you won't regret it...|
60181|#&7$Simón##br#
"¡Épale, mis panas! %n%, you are looking as fornido as ever, yes?#br#
 And Angel, you... you... yes, well some things do not change."#br#Simón shrugs his shoulders in helpless factuality. #M825010s100+30$Simón$301$$1$0#

#&7$Angel##br#
"Ha! My DEAR friend, Simón. Glad to see you're in as fine form as always.#br#
 Back for a rematch? Or just here to berate me with your normal drivel?"#br#
 Angel turns on his heels with the crispness of twenty uniformed men, eyes#br#piercing through the small rabbit's skull. #M308060$Angel$4$$0$0#

#&7$Simón##br#
"Alas, I have no time to lambaste you with my ingenio sin límites today, my overweening#br# compatriot. I have far more important matters to attend to back at the lodge.#br#
 Old Simón simply wanted to inform %n% of new status as official contestant of the#br#
 #&46$Hunter's Hoppadrome#! As such, the public demands blood!"
   #M825010s100+30$Simón$831$$1$0#

#&7$Angel##br#
"Th-... the Hunter's Hoppadrome?! Cripes, %n%! You didn't tell me you were climbing#br# up through the ranks that fast! You've gotta let your old man in on these things!#br#
 Don't keep me in the dark!" Angel whistles beneath his breath as he sizes you up. #M308060$Angel$823$$0$0#

#&7$Simón##br#
"%n% is MY crío! Do not be taking them from me, you libertino astuto!"#br# Simón's ears shrink back, practically pasted to the top of his head.#br#
 "En todo caso, your fans are in an uproar! They deMAND to see more!#br#
 Who am I to deny them as such? Simón always keeps his people happy."
   #M825010s100+30$Simón$822$$1$0#

#&7$Simón##br#
"The rules have not been changing! All that has changed is the PRESSURE! Ohoho!#br#
 Yes, yes, when you are ready, you come to see Simón. I shall be waaaaiting for you, my friend!"#br#And with that, Simón takes off as suddenly as he'd arrived, leaving you and Angel standing#br#in stupefied silence. #M825010s100+30$Simón$821$$1$0#|
60182|#&7$Angel##br#
"Well, kid! You did good. As much as it pains me to agree with that hubristic conquistador,#br#
 you're really moving up in the world. You can count on me being there to cheer you on!#br#No short skirts, though. I don't do that whole cheerleader thing." Angel gives you#br#a hefty clout on the shoulder that leaves you wheezing for air. #M308060$Angel$821$$1$0#|
60183|#&7$Angel##br#
"Goll-LEE! The Hoppadrome? At YOUR age?#br#
 I barely even knew what it WAS when I was that young..."#br#Angel shakes his head with a whistle. #M308060$Angel$4$$1$0#|
60184|#&7$Simón##br#
"Feast your eyes on the hordes most ravenous! They are all here for YOU!#br#
 If you are truly ready to tame the savage beast, then enter the ring. Simply talking#br#to old Simón does not count—tocar no es entrar, after all!" #M825010s100+30$Simón$821$$1$0#

#&7$Simón##br#
"Of course, you must be looking your best, no? What is this dirt?#br#
 ¡Peina tu cabello! ¡Lavate la cara! I cannot be sending you into the#br#
 ring like this!" Simón begins hastily straightening your clothes,#br#one paw removing a speck of invisible dust from your shoulder. #M825010s100+30$Simón$823$$1$0#

#&7$Simón##br#
"Now, you listen to me! This tournament is no walk in the park, as you Elysians#br# say. You cannot let even one thing go unnoticed! Those beasts are viciosos!#br#
 One wrong move and they will tear the trachea from your neck! Also, if you#br#
 do not win, I cannot buy myself a new crossbow. Do not let me down, %n%!"
     #M825010s100+30$Simón$831$$1$0#|
60190|Despite feeling like a third wheel after your conversation with Simón and Delphia, you can't help the excited flutter of butterflies in your stomach upon knowing you're headed for the big leagues—the Hero's Hoppadrome!

When the public demands blood, the public GETS blood! Head over to the Lapitaro Lodge and sign yourself up... if you dare.|
60191|#&7$Delphia##br#
"Oh, %n%! You're back. You look tired, dear, perhaps you should take a rest? You've certainly been putting in a lot of effort these days—you deserve a little#br#
 break, hm?" Delphia tilts her head with an encouraging smile.
   #M327090$Delphia$4$51$1$0#

#&7$Simón##br#
"¡Dios nos libre! Do not take even a single step, %n%!#br#
 I have been looking all over for you, mi pana elusivo!"#br#
 Simón appears from seemingly out of nowhere, a fiery glint in his eyes. #M825010s100+30$Simón$301$$0$0#

#&7$Delphia##br#
"Oh, look at yoooooou! A little firecracker, like always!#br#
 Get over here and let your Auntie Delphy give you a hug!"#br#
 Delphia picks Simón up in her arms, squeezing him to her chest. #M327090$Delphia$4$51$1$0#

#&7$Simón##br#
"P-... pleased am I, as well, to be in your presence again, mi cachapa."#br#
 Simón sputters and wriggles until he's free of Delphia's grasp. He quickly#br#
smooths down his fur, face slightly pink. "But this is a matter of much import!#br#
 The crowd calls for blood! %n%'s blood! They want you back in the ring!" #M825010s100+30$Simón$831$$0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You blink in utter shock. Back to the Hoppadrome? Then, could this mean...#br#
 ...you're strong enough to participate in a higher division? Not wanting to get your#br#
 hopes up lest they be dashed, you quickly ask for confirmation from Simón.#char$$821$$1$0#

#&7$Simón##br#
"¡No puede ser! You mean you do not know? They are clamoring for you, %n%—and#br#
 I do not use that word often. Word on the street is that you are más peligroso que barbero#br#
 con hipo! We have no choice but to promote you, yes? To the spoils, go the victor, as#br#
 they say, ohoho! You must come immediately to join the #&46$Hero's Hoppadrome#!" #M825010s100+30$Simón$831$$0$0#

#&7$Delphia##br#
"My, my, %n%! I didn't know you were the talk of the town around here!
 You need to keep me informed of these things! Give me a chance to join your fan club, hm?#br#
 There's nothing quite as fun as watching your favorite people caught in a battle of life,#br#
 death, and blood..." The wistful sigh that passes Delphia's lips somewhat disturbs you. #M327090$Delphia$824$51$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You quickly tell Delphia that you, yourself, hadn't known you were becoming such a#br#
 big name around here. In fact, maybe certain Hoppalongs should have informed#br#you of this EARlier...#char$$4$$1$0#

#&7$Simón##br#
Unfortunately, Simón doesn't catch onto your vilifying tone. "Surely, you've informed#br# the child of your own days of carnicería sangrienta in the ring, no? You have not been#br#
 keeping them in the darkness, have you?" Simón elbows Delphia playfully, his lips#br#curling into a knowing smirk. #M825010s100+30$Simón$831$$0$0#

#&7$Delphia##br#
"Oh, dear! I wouldn't want to, I mean... I would never..." Delphia fans herself bashfully.#br#
 "I had a little fun in the Hoppadrome myself, back in the day. I only won, like, oh... five or ten#br#
 tournaments! They called me the Queen of Pain. B-but stop making me tell you all about my#br#
 life, %n%!" She giggles in flustered chagrin and abruptly smacks you across the face. #M327090$Delphia$4$51$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You rub your cheek with a groan, looking for some kind of answer#br#
 from Simón, but only see the two of them laughing at you.#char$$823$$1$0#

#&7$Simón##br#
"¡Viva la Reina del Dolor! Those were some good times, were they not? It almost brings#br#
 a tear to my eye... but enough of this nostalgia-ing! We must... to the #&46$Lapitaro Lodge#!
 Or at least you must, %n%. Old Simón would like to stay a big longer with his hermosa flor,#br#
 reliving some of those good old days..." Simón takes Delphia's hand, the epitome of suave. #M825010s100+30$Simón$4$$0$0#|
60192|#&7$Delphia##br#
"Oh, %n%! Weren't you supposed to head over to the Hoppadrome?#br# Those bloodthirsty fans of your won't wait, you know!" Her saccharine smile#br#
 juxtaposed with the mention of blood gives you a strange sense of dread that curdles in your stomach... #M327090$Delphia$4$51$1$0#|
60193|#&7$Delphia##br#
"%n%, you're back! I trust the tournament went well? I want to hear ALL about it!#br#  Living through today's youth is what keeps old grannies like me alive!"#br#
 As Delphia's face glows with euphoria, you can't help but wonder... just how old IS she?! #M327090$Delphia$4$51$1$0#|
60194|#&7$Simón##br#
"%n%! Finally, you have come. Prepare your gónadas!"#br#
 Simón clenches his tiny fists, eyes ablaze with the furor of#br#fifty blazing saddles. #M825010s100+30$Simón$831$$1$0#

#&7$Simón##br#
"Enter the ring and give your fans the fight they so desperately seek!#br#
 I am afraid I will not be watching you this time, though, mi pana."#br#
 Delphia and I have a fecha caliente, and old Simón has more queso than a tequeño!"#br#Simón licks his paw before using it to slick back his fur. #M825010s100+30$Simón$821$$1$0#|

#&7$Chester##br#
"You know what else is a gamble? Finding Neverrealms! Also... hunting! You never#br# know what you'll find. What's more, just FINDING Neverrealms the places is an expensive#br#

 %p% behind their ears, but there's something slightly manic about the glint#br#
in her eyes. #M307030$Maria$821$$1$0#

#&7$Maria##br#
"Actually, Van Pelt informed me earlier! Told me 'some' of his fellow Falcons would#br#

"What a sweetheart! So full of energy at that age..." Maria sighs wistfully as though#br#
 the otter isn't in the process of mauling your companion. "He'll have to be tamed, of#br# course, but that's where you'll come in! He'll have LOTS of room to frolic and play on#br#your ranch as you train him in all manner of Dragomon etiquette." #M307030$Maria$4$$1$0#

"If you succeed in fulling taming the little rascal, you'll earn yourself a Dragomon Glyph!#br#

"You've been raising an awful lot of Dragomon lately, right? Well, to give#br#
 each Dragomon the space it needs to thrive, we've renovated your ranch—free#br#
 of charge! Not only have we added a pasture for your Dragomon, we've also#br#

   #M330040$Darte$821$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Darte, the Dragoon Cavalier, is impressed with YOU?!#br#
 You chest swells with pride and you feel yourself grow at least two centimeters#br#
 taller. You nod your head resolutely, ready and willing to accept any challenge.#char$$806$$0$0#

#&7$Darte##br#
"Heh. Just as I thought. Can't stay away from me can you?#br# I'm the only one here who can show you what a true hunter is made of, after all.#br#
 I'll warn you, though... once we get started, you may find yourself biting off more than#br#
 you can chew..." Darte's eyes glint as he passes you a letter.
   #M330040$Darte$824$$1$0#

#&7$Darte##br#
"Take that letter to DuFresne. He's... around.#br#
 He should be able to fill you in on the details."#br#
 After that, though... heh. You're on your own."#br#
 Darte gives your shoulder a hearty shake before walking off with a laugh. #M330040$Darte$4$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Darte certainly doesn't waste his words on explanations, does he?#br#
 What's that letter, though, huh? What's it say? What's it for?"#pets100+30$$822$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Hoping to assuage your companion's curiosity, you scrutinize the letter Darte gave you.#br#
 The paper is high quality, pure white, soft, and thick. It's embossed with a set of ornate#br#
 red and blue symbols. You shake your head, telling %p% that you haven't the foggiest.#br#
 It looks like you're going to have to find DuFresne after all...#char$$810$$0$0#|

#M305030$DuFresne$1$$1$0#|
60283|#&7$DuFresne##br#
"Alright, seeing as you're looking like you're caught between a rock and a #br#
 hard place, you must have heard both sides of the argument, yeah? So... how #br#
 about it? Have you decided which side to join?"   #M305030$DuFresne$4$$1$0#

#&7$DuFresne##br#
"There's no rush, really! I mean, as long as you have a Faction Reselection Application,#br#
 you can change factions at any time! Means you don't have to worry too much about#br#
 making a wrong decision, am I right?" DuFresne laughs somewhat unfittingly. #M305030$DuFresne$821$$1$0#

#&7$DuFresne##br#
"Anyway, give it some thought and make a decision, yeah?#br#
 Gotta determine which faction you'll fight with in future battles, after all!#br#
 Choose a faction that shares your values! Or give into peer pressure#br#
 and choose the faction all your friends are in. Doesn't matter to me!" #M305030$DuFresne$4$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 All this information is a LOT to take in! What are you gonna decide?#br#
 Should you join the freedom seekers of the #&46$Free Trappers#,#br#
 or take refuge in the security of the #&308$Wardens' Federation#?#br#
 You'll have to give it some thought!#char$$810$$0$0#|
60284|#&7$DuFresne##br#
"Wh-whoa! More hunters? Erm... marvelous! Yes! Marvelous. Of course.#br#
 Can you please, uh, wait a moment? The present situation is... well, how should I put it?#br#
 Actually, let's not split hairs here—it's straight up dangerous! Very dangerous!#br# So much danger!" DuFresne's fret-level seems to be rising with each passing minute.
   #M305030$DuFresne$4$$1$0#

#&7$Mora##br#
"Calling all ambitious hunters! Sign up with the #&308$Wardens' Federation# to secure#br# Elysium's status in the hall of nations! We need trustworthy people to help defend and#br#
 expand our trade networks!" The woman beside you suddenly lets out a squawk#br#
 that makes your ears ring.
   #M309050$Mora$821$$0$0#

#&7$Tyrone##br#
"Don't listen to her! She doesn't know what she's rabbiting on about!#br#
 Trade? TRADE?! Trade alone won't secure Elysium's status!#br#
 Join the #&46$Free Trappers# and build on the strength of our guilds!#br#
 We'll turn Elysium into a city that's known for the might of its hunters!"
   #M326090$Tyrone$825$$1$0#

#&7$Mora##br#
"Oh, get it together, Tyrone! Don't you EVER stop prattling on?#br# I thought we'd agreed to let each other promote our own factions#br#
 without CEASELESS heckling! And I don't know what ELSE I'd call#br#
 that humdrum coming out of your mouth!" Mora spins around in a flurry.
   #M309050$Mora$825$$0$0#

#&7$Tyrone##br#
"YOU'RE one to talk, Mora! It's weeeell before the time we agreed on#br#
 to start promoting, and you've already been here for an hour handing#br#
 out leaflets! If I hadn't found you out, you'd have had who KNOWS how much#br#
 free advertising time!" Tyrone stamps on the floor to emphasize his point.
   #M326090$Tyrone$826$$1$0#

#&7$DuFresne##br#
"Hey, guys? C'mon, guys! I really think we should try a non-violent approach to#br#
 resolve this! Everyone's sick and tired of your constant bickering! Just ask this hunter#br#
 right here! You'll see!" DuFresne nudges you forward, and you almost fall#br#
 flat on your face in the middle of the crowd.
    #M305030$DuFresne$826$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You find yourself at a loss for words. You don't like confrontations!#br#
 Instead of responding, you state your name and pull out Darte's letter.#br#
 Everyone simply stares at you, silent as the grave.#char$$807$$0$0#
  

#&7$Tyrone##br#
"How could this happen? And from Darte of all people, too! This is all getting too much for me. Too MUCH!"#br#
 Tyrone brings his hands to his head, eyes nearly popping from their sockets.
  
   #M326090$Tyrone$823$$1$0#

#&7$Mora##br#
"Good day to you, %n%! And my, what a strapping young hunter, you are! You simply#br# MUST accept our invitation to join the Federation. We know how to treat our... special#br#
 members well, and you would clearly be an asset to us." There's something about#br#
 Mora's tone that tells you she's got her eyes on more than just your membership.
   #M309050$Mora$822$$1$0#

#&7$DuFresne##br#
"Hey! or we don't do them at all, you got that?! Our most honored guest came here#br#
 to visit ME! So... everyone's gotta wait their turn! Yeah!"#br#
 DuFresne squares his shoulders and turns to you.
   #M305030$DuFresne$825$$1$0#

#&7$DuFresne##br#
"I'm sorry you had to see this, %n%. A real embarrassment. A REAL embarrassment!#br#
 Normally we handle things a bit more, erm, professionally? Anyway! It's rather unorthodox,#br#
 but seeing as you were recommended by Darte himself, you won't have any paperwork to#br#
 deal with, so... why don't I go ahead and just fill you in on this whole crazy mess, yeah?" #M305030$DuFresne$821$$1$0#

#&7$DuFresne##br#
"You see, Elysium is at a crossroads, and what we decide now will irrevocably shape its future!#br#
 After much discussion, we've drawn up two policies for the future of the city. One faction#br#
 is the #&46$Free Trappers#, and the other is the #&308$Wardens' Federation#." DuFresne motions towards
 Mora and Tyrone, whom instantly stop glaring at each other to shoot you identical smiles. #M305030$DuFresne$4$$1$0#

#&7$DuFresne##br#
"But we've reached a stalemate! Whenever votes have been cast, we've seen equal support#br#
 for both factions, so we can't—in all conscience—decide definitively which is best for Elysium.#br# Tensions have risen until the leaders of both factions have decided to resort to the simplest #br#
 but most brutal way to decide once and for all—a savage, uncivilized test of strength."
   #M305030$DuFresne$821$$1$0#

#&7$DuFresne##br#
"The original aim was to stimulate Elysium's growth and prove its strength as a city.#br#
 Thus, a test of physical brawn DOES make sense—that's why both factions are desperately#br#
 seeking hunters at the moment. They both want to make sure their side has strength in#br#
 numbers so they can pulverize the other faction." #M305030$DuFresne$4$$1$0#

#&7$DuFresne##br#
"So... there you are! I've said my piece. Now, I suggest you go and speak to both factions#br# so you can weigh up their core values and political goals. I'm relying on you to make#br#
 a well-informed decision! Don't get taken in by any of their cajoling and flattery.#br#
 This decision is going to affect Elysium's entire future—never forget that."
   #M305030$DuFresne$822$$1$0#|
60285|#&7$Tyrone##br#
"Pleasure to meet you, %n%! I'm Ambassador Tyrone of the #&46$Free Trappers#.#br#
 I'm DREADFULLY sorry you had to see that, uh, little altercation earlier...#br#
 It shouldn't have happened, but, well, you know... some people just never learn!"#br#
 Tyrone looks at Mora with ill-disguised contempt, which Mora isn't slow to return.
   #M326090$Tyrone$822$$1$0#

#&7$Tyrone##br#
"Anyway! Onto more important things! I will now give you a run-down on what my#br# faction intends to do if we win the vote. Mostly, we'd like to #&46$open all the hunting fields##br#
 and let hunters roam freely within them. We believe this is integral in letting hunters#br#
 train and increase their strength and skillsets! Makes sense, doesn't it?"
   #M326090$Tyrone$821$$1$0#

#&7$Tyrone##br#
"In order to do so, we'll have to ask the council to remove restrictions on each of the fields.#br#
 This will, however, increase the number of risks present when leaving on a hunt.#br#
 But, hey! How can you improve when you're wrapped up in cotton wool? We need risk#br#
 or we can never hope to truly improve!"#br# Tyrone's eyes shine with glistening passion. #M326090$Tyrone$4$$1$0#

#&7$Tyrone##br#
"What's more, we'll have to reduce some of the security measures currently in place.#br#
 'Cuz we can only improve by exposing ourselves to risk, right? Nature's all about survival #br#
 of the fittest! Only then will Elysium's guilds become truly strong. If anything catastrophic#br#
 were to happen, WE'LL be ready! WE'LL be waiting! And WE'LL be able to handle it!"
   #M326090$Tyrone$825$$1$0#

#&7$Tyrone##br#
"To make these dreams come true, though, we need an ambitious hunter who shares our#br#
 views and isn't afraid to take the safety off. With your help, we can truly achieve our#br#
 goal and make this a stronger place. If you agree with anything I've just said, then you#br#
 MUST join the #&46$Free Trappers#. Let's pave the way to Elysium's future... today!"
   #M326090$Tyrone$822$$1$0#|
60286|#&7$Mora##br#
"Welcome %n%, and thank you for doing us the honor of hearing our side of things. The#br#
 #&308$Wardens' Federation# is a peace-seeking organization that puts the safety of Elysium#br#
 and its peoples first and foremost. We want hunters to enjoy a safe environment in which#br#
 they can focus on harvesting the materials that will contribute to Elysium's growing economy."#br#
   #M309050$Mora$4$$1$0#

#&7$Mora##br#
"In order to achieve this goal, we plan to set up a system whereby professional scouts are#br#
 sent into promising hunting fields to provide regular updates on the safety and profitability#br#
 of each separate field. This will enable everyone to hunt as productively, efficiently,#br#
 and as SAFELY as possible." Mora throws a disparaging side-glance at Tyrone.
   #M309050$Mora$821$$1$0#

#&7$Mora##br#
"I believe that hunters want to focus on structured, concrete goals! Not waste their precious #br#
 energy on fruitless, aimless expeditions. There may be less adventure involved, granted,#br#
 but it means that hunters can GUAranTEE good results—and they won't have to risk life#br#
 and limb on pointless exercises." Mora nods her head firmly to emphasize her point.#br#
   #M309050$Mora$824$$1$0#

#&7$Mora##br#
"I hope that after giving it careful thought, you will see that the #&308$Wardens' Federation##br#
 is the only sensible way forward. If we win this battle between the factions— and I am confident#br#
 it's just a matter of time—Elysium will thrive in a new era of peace and security. With your#br#
 help, hunters will get their just reward for all their hard work... withOUT risking their lives!"#br#

 I guess you've come to ask me about how to throw a #&46$banquet#, huh?#br#
 Let me give you a rundown of the basics..." #M307010$Farina$821$$1$0#

#&7$Farina##br#
"Banquets are really just friendly events where your friends come over for dinner.#br#
 You can have#&46$Small Dinners#, #&46$Big Banquets#, or #&46$VIP Banquets.#" With so many to choose from, it never gets old!"#M307010$Farina$822$$1$0#

"Anyone that shows up to one of these banquets can get#br#
 a generous side dish of EXP simply by continuing to eat!#br#

 How do we host a banquet then?"#br#

#&7$Farina##br#
"It's easy as pie—if you want
 to host a banquet, you need a #&46$Banquet Invitation#.#br#
 Different kinds of banquets need different kinds of invites, am I right?"#br#
#br#
 *#&46$Banquet invitations# may be purchased from #&46$Farina# or in the #&46$Item Mall.##M307010$Farina$4$$1$0#

#&7$Farina##br#
"Once your invite's ready, open the Ranch Interface and switch to the Host Banquet page.#br#
 Then, simply select the type of banquet you wish to host and click the #&46$Host Banquet# button!"

 But what if we want to attend someone else's banquet?"#br#
 %p% asks, his mouth watering as much as before.#pets100+30$$831$$0$0#

#&7$Farina##br#
"There are a couple of ways to get in on someone else's banquet." #M307010$Farina$822$$1$0#

#&7$Farina##br#
"The first and simplest is by using a #&46$Banquet Invitation# issued by another player." #M307010$Farina$821$$1$0#

#&7$Farina##br#
"The second is to go directly to whichever ranch is hosting a banquet#br#
 and clicking on a vacant #&46$seat# to join in on the eating." #M307010$Farina$821$$1$0#

#&7$Farina##br#
"But remember, there's a restriction as to how many folks can attend any one party!#br#
 #&46$Small Dinners# are limited to #&46$five guests#, while #&46$Big Banquets# and #&46$VIP Banquets##br#
 can host as many as #&46$twenty guests#. Once the limit has been reached, however, no more#br#guests can be invited or join." #M307010$Farina$826$$1$0#

#&7$Farina##br#
"Don't forget! 
 Whether you're attending someone else's banquet or hosting one of your own,#br#

 or you'll miss out on the EXP and buffs!" #M307010$Farina$4$$1$0#

#&7$Farina##br#
"Well, that's the down and dirty gist of the matter.#br#
 If there's anything you didn't get, just ask me again!" #M307010$Farina$2$$1$0#|

#&7$%n%##br#
 Hopponga Fest? Sounds like a rollicking good time! Just as you're#br#
 about to ask %p% if they knew of this upcoming fiesta, they let#br#
 out a bloodcurdling shriek that destroys every cilia in your ears.#char$$823$$0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"The Hopponga Fest! THE HOPPONGA FEST!#br# I completely forgot! Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, nonononononono..."#br#
 %p% begins rocking back and forth while tugging hysterically#br#
 at their ears.#pets100+30$$825$$1$0#

70132|...|
70133|#&7$Karen##br#
"The Hopponga Fest is our most important festival. According to legend, the#br#first Hoppalong ever to spread its ears was born on this very day!"
 #M809010s100+30$Karen$831$$1$0#

#&7$Karen##br#
"One wintry evening, all was silent, and muffled in snow.#br#
 When—all of a sudden—a blinding, white light streaked across the sky!#br#
 Slowing as it approached the ground, it brought with it the first, holy#br#Hoppalong to this world." #M809010s100+30$Karen$1$$1$0#

#&7$Karen##br#
"This sacred Hoppalong taught the other Hoppalongs to read and write,#br#
 imparting on them a veritable El Dorado of knowledge and skills. Had it not#br#
 been for that fateful night, we would all still be living in warrens, chewing on mud!" #M809010s100+30$Karen$831$$1$0#

#&7$Karen##br#
"And thus it is that every year, we Hoppalongs gather together in#br#
 in commemoration of our great Mother, and hold a grand festival#br#
 of sorts. Quite the smashing occasion, really." #M809010s100+30$Karen$1$$1$0#

#&7$Karen##br#
"This year is no exception! I've been hearing about all sorts of wonderful treats that#br#
 Fate has come up with! As well as, hrm, news that Omi, too, has prepared a number#br#
 of dishes..." At the mention of Omi, Karen falls into troubled silence.
   #M809010s100+30$Karen$831$$1$0#

#&7$Karen##br#
"...in any case, the Hopponga Fest is our most important day of the year.#br# There'll be all sorts of activities and events for you and %p% to partake in.#br#
 It should be simply MARvelous!" Karen does a little spin, her ears flopping gracefully. #M809010s100+30$Karen$822$$1$0#|
70140|In preparation for the Hopponga Fest, Fate has cultivated a small sapling; however, as she's inundated with other party preparations, she doesn't have the time to look after it.

Fate asks you to water the sapling in the Fountain Square using her patent-pending Wonder Grow.|
70141|#&7$Fate##br#
 You're casually meandering Elysium's cobblestones when Fate waves to you.#br#
"Hello, %n%... Are you... busy?"#M808010s100+30$Fate$831$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You walk over, a bounce in your step, and find Fate holding#br#a bottle of strangely-colored fluid.
 #char$$806$$0$0#

#&7$Fate##br#
 Fate gives the bottle a little shake. "This is... Wonder Grow... for the sapling..."
#M808010s100+30$Fate$1$$1$0#

#&7$Fate##br#
"To celebrate... Hopponga Fest, I've cultivated a little... sapling...#br# But... I've had... no time to water it... so... it will probably die...#br#
 Could you do it... for me? Perhaps? Just use this... Wonder Grow...#br#
 Should... do the trick..."
 #M808010s100+30$Fate$831$$1$0#|
70142|#&7$Fate##br#
"The sapling is in... the Fountain Square...#br#
 Shouldn't be... too hard to find... not many other saplings there...#br# Please water it with... the Wonder Grow..."#M808010s100+30$Fate$831$$1$0#|
70143|#&7$Fate##br#
"How is the sapling... coming along...?"#M808010s100+30$Fate$831$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You inform her that after you poured in the mixture, it began growing#br#thick and fast! Almost alarmingly so.#char$$821$$0$0#

#&7$Fate##br#
"That's... good to hear. Thank you... for the help..."#M808010s100+30$Fate$822$$1$0# |

70150|Omi has taken it upon himself to rustle up a Hopponga Fest feast for everyone! Unfortunately for him, but fortunately for everyone else, 

he hasn't had the time to collect the ingredients he needs. He needs you to head to Crescent Bay and collect Raptite Scales and Rock Gigant Saliva to use in his culinary creations.|

 gather the ingredients! Which is where YOU come in, my furry little friend."
   #M803010s100+30$Omi$602$$1$0#

#&7$Omi##br#
"I need Raptite Scales and Rock Gigant Saliva to make this feast work... and LOTS of it!#br#
 Think you can handle that for me? You should be able to find both the brutes in Crescent Bay!" #M803010s100+30$Omi$602$$1$0#|
70152|#&7$Omi##br#
"Oh, dear, oh, dear... Busy, busy, BUSY!"#br#
 You can barely see Omi buried amongst all his dishes. #M803010s100+30$Omi$602$$1$0#|
70153|#&7$%n%##br#
 Materials in hand, you approach Omi from behind.#br# Before you even manage open your mouth, though, Omi speaks. #M803010s100+30$Omi$602$$1$0#

#&7$Omi##br#
"%n%! Back already, hey? Thanks for the help! Thanks for the help!#br#
 Just leave the stuff over there! I'll need it here in a bit."#br# Omi gestures with his hand, not even turning to look at you.#br#
 You really wonder HOW he does it sometimes... #M803010s100+30$Omi$602$$1$0#|
70160|Omi has finished making his food, but has no time to deliver it!

It's up to you again to deliver the food to his hungry patrons.|
70161|#&7$Omi##br#
"%n%, let's be real. You agree that food is best eaten when it's still hot#br#and fresh out the oven, right?" #M803010s100+30$Omi$821$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You're a little unsure of the underlying motives for this question,#br#but you tentatively nod your head yes.#char$$806$$0$0#

#&7$Omi##br#
"I KNEW you'd understand! Perfect. Deliver this food for me, then, will you?#br# Would do it myself, but, heh. I'm a bit busy here, after all. Gotta keep the food#br#
 comin', am I right? I've left a note in each basket to let you know who it's for.#br# A fellow food connoisseur such as yourself would make sure to deliver it hot, right?"
     #M803010s100+30$Omi$822$$1$0#|
70162|#&7$Omi##br#
"Oh, dear, oh, dear... Busy, busy, BUSY!"#br#
 You can barely see Omi buried amongst all his dishes. #M803010s100+30$Omi$806$$1$0#|
70163|#&7$Omi##br#
"Wonderful! Excellent! Great job, %n%! If I ever need you to deliver food again,#br#
 I know JUST who to call." Omi finally does you the decency of looking at you, but only#br#
 for a second. Then it's back to the culinary grindstone. You take this opportunity#br#to sneak away... quickly. #M803010s100+30$Omi$822$$1$0#|
70170|Omi's dishes have somehow brought Fate's ice sculptures to life!

Though nothing short of miraculous, this is unacceptable. Marvin begs you to defeat the icy Hoppalongs now running amok. Oh, and the Snowfloe King, too, while you're at it.|
70171|#&7$Marvin##br#
You're walking along, minding your own business, when you hear a familiar cough#br#
 from behind you. Turning around, you see Marvin, all decked out in his typical#br#
 smirk. "%n%! You wouldn't happen to have seen anything, I don't know, new or unusual#br#in Elysium lately, would you have?" #M812010s100+30$Marvin$831$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You turn to look at what Marvin is pointing at, only to feel your eyes bug out of their sockets.#br#
 The Hoppalong ice sculptures have... have... come to life! And are running around on#br#their own accord!#char$$823$$0$0#

#&7$Marvin##br#
"So, here's what's happened, see? I ask Fate to make me some ice sculptures that won't#br#
 melt, right? That part's fine! Works perfectly, see? Problem is, I accidently got some of#br#
 Omi's food on them! Now usually that wouldn't be a problem, see? Except that it seems to#br#
 have made them come to life! Quite astonishing, really. Omi's food must be something special!" #M812010s100+30$Marvin$825$$1$0#

#&7$Marvin##br#
"Who'd have guessed! Anyway, I was planning to sell these sculptures, make a quick#br#
 buck, see? But who's going to buy these abominations now? I need you to destroy#br#them. Can't have them running around like that. Bad for business, see?" #M812010s100+30$Marvin$826$$1$0#

#&7$Marvin##br#
"You're going to need these special snowballs. Made by Fate specially to deal with these#br#
 ice sculptures, see? I don't understand how it works, and—frankly—I don't give a dang.#br#
 All I need you to do is hit these sculptures with the snowballs. Get rid of 'em sharpish, see?#br#
 Time's a wastin'! I ain't gettin' any richer with you just standing around."   #M812010s100+30$Marvin$831$$1$0#

#&7$Marvin##br#
"Oh, one more thing. Heard there's a Snowfloe King among 'em.#br#
 That one's 'specially nasty, so you're going to want to take him out.#br#
 Oh, and apparently he's got some special crystals, see? Nab a few#br#
 for me, and I'll make it worth your while..." #M812010s100+30$Marvin$822$$1$0#

70251|#&7$Omi##br#
"Dashing through the snow, in a one-horse open... wait a minute! HA! What's gotten#br#
 into me, huh? It ain't Christmas! It's Easter! I mean, just look around at the pastel colors!#br#

 eggs, of course! DYED eggs! Was thinking about rectifying this little issue myself, but I#br#

"I know exactly what you're gonna ask though—where in Sam Hill am I supposed to#br#

 do is ask Olaf and Elli! They should get you all fixed up. Once you've got the goods,#br#
 I'll make you the biggest, baddest, most hip-hoppin' batch of eggs you've ever seen!" #M803010s100+30$Omi$824$$1$0#|

70253|#&7$Omi##br#
"Hey, hey, hey! Cottontail's comin' tonight! Look at all these eggs! And so many colors#br#
 of dye! I'm in egg-stacy! Time to dye... hard! Oh, right—figure a fella should thank#br#
 a guy for such a grand egg delivery, yeah? So here's that SPECIAL egg I may or may#br#
 not have mentioned earlier. I'm sure you'll find some use for it..."#M803010s100+30$Omi$824$$1$0#|
70254|#&7$Olaf##br#
"What a cotton-pickin' pickle! I just got in this enormous shipment of dyes that I didn't#br#

70260|Seems just about every Hoppalong in the world enjoys digging up eggs, and why shouldn't they? Especially colorful, lovable, pastel-painted EASTER eggs!

Once again, Omi's on the job this Easter. He's already had Fate bury a bunch of just these sorts of eggs all around Crescent Bay! Why not take the time to enjoy the season and join the hunt?|
70261|#&7$Omi##br#
"Thumpity, thump, thump, thumpity, thump, thump, to bury some eggs, I go...#br#
 HA! Look at me with the Christmas tunes again. Hey, you ever wondered what#br#
 would happen if you mixed Easter and Christmas? Eastmas! Where you open lots#br#of presents but they're all eggs! Hyuck hyuck hyuck, I crack myself up." #M803010s100+30$Omi$2$$1$0#

#&7$Omi##br#
"Ah, whatever! Say, %n%, how'd you like to join in my little egg hunting#br#

#&7$Omi##br#
"Bring me back enough eggs, and I may even reward you with a SPECIAL egg.#br#
 What's so special about it? You'll have to find out! But trust me—it'll BLOW. YOUR.#br#

   #M803010s100+30$Omi$824$$1$0#|
70262|#&7$Omi##br#
"Here an egg, there an egg, everywhere an egg, egg..."#br# Omi whistles a joyful tune as he gets to work dyeing more eggs. #M803010s100+30$Omi$824$$1$0#|
70263|#&7$Omi##br#
"You're back! Ohoho, eggcellent! EGGCELLENT! How'd you fair? How'd you score?#br#
 Lemme catch a glimpse of those EGGS!" Omi begins counting the eggs in your#br#
 basket with mildly euphoric glee. "Wonderful! You've really outdone yourself#br#
 this time, %n%! Here you go, as promise—one of my SPECIAL eggs! On the house!" #M803010s100+30$Omi$822$$1$0#|
70270|Omi's last plans for Easter include distributing his patent-pending surprise eggs! You're not sure what the surprise is, but maybe that's for the best.

At any rate, he hopes that you'll be the Easter Bunny, so to speak, and deliver them to some of his good friends. Take the surprise egg grab bags to Olaf, Mholt and Marvin.|
70271|#&7$Omi##br#
"Hey, %n%, you remember that chocolate I made for Valentine's Day? Ack. I forgot.#br#
 You didn't have a special someone to give it to, so you didn't partake. Sorry to bring#br#
 up sensitive subjects! At any rate, Mholt and Marvin gave me rave reviews, so I'm#br#
 reusing the recipe... in egg form! Seems like a solid plan, wouldn't you say?" #M803010s100+30$Omi$824$$1$0#

#&7$Omi##br#
"And that's not all! Lookit what I've done with 'em, ohoho! I've arranged them in#br#
 these green wicker, plastic-grass-filled, Grab Bags! Aren't they the most precious#br#
 little things you've ever seen? Everyone's gonna be DYEin' to get some! Get it?#br#Dyein'? Ah, whatever. You don't even go to this school." #M803010s100+30$Omi$1$$1$0#

#&7$Omi##br#
"The only hitch I've discovered in this chocolate-covered, pastel-painted plan of#br#
 mine is that I can't leave my post to deliver my bags! So I was hoping, well, heheh...#br#
 I was hoping that maybe YOU could deliver 'em for me, huh? I'll even give you your#br#
 OWN special, surprise, milk chocolately surprise egg in return! How's that?" #M803010s100+30$Omi$822$$1$0#|

70275|#&7$Mholt##br#
"What's this? An Easter basket? For me? Whomever is it from? Ah, dearest Omi. I#br#
 should have known that jolly old soul would do something such as this. I can still#br#
 remember those Valentine's chocolates naught but a few months ago. How that#br#
 chocolate melted like liquefied, edible tungsten betwixt my teeth..." #M805010s100+30$Mholt$825$$1$0#|

 Oh! It's from Omi, is it? Heh. Well, I did enjoy those Valentine's chocolates of#br# his earlier, so I suppose this'll mean I'll like these eggs as well. I'll take 'em!" #M812010s100+30$Marvin$1$$1$0#|

 You see Delphia gazing into the distance from time to time as though she's expecting someone.#br#
 Curious, you can't help but to go over and ask her if she needs help with anything.

#&7$Delphia##br#
"Oh! %n%!  Fancy meeting you here. You seem as chipper as ever.#br#
 Alas, I'm in a bind. Have you heard about the magazine 'Hunter's Weekly'?"

#&7$%n%##br#
 You recall hearing that Hunter's Weekly is slowly increasing it's readership in Elysium.#br#
 It reports on the latest news in hunter unions around the capital, among other things.#br#
 They also do exposes on rising stars that have not yet officially joined a union.

#&7$Delphia##br#
"And they chose... well, ME! As their latest cover girl! Such a rare opportunity...#br#
 To look my finest, I ordered a simply gorgeous new coat from the clothing franchisor."

#&7$Delphia##br#
"But with the appointment I made with Hunter's Weekly fast approaching,#br# 
 my coat has still not arrived! I'm simply beside myself on account of it.#br#

"Oh, dear! Oh, dearie me!
 What am I going to do?#br#
 If I screw up on Falcon business, I'll never be able to face them again!"#br#

"Oh, dear! Oh, dearie me!
 As you can see, I'm having a few difficulties with this coat...#br#
 I was once known as the world's best tailor, but now I feel like calling it a day..."

 You're about to console the dejected tailor with a hearty hug#br#
 when she abruptly raises her head, her fighting spirit seemingly restored.#npc$$825$$1$0#

#&7$Lylabell##br#
"No! I'll not bow before a smattering of needles, thread, and cloth!"#br#

 It normally takes me almost a day...#br#
 You're really quite something, you know?"#npc$$823$$1$0#

#&7$Lylabell##br#
"Good!  Now that I have the feathers..."#br#
 Lylabell's expression is filled with determination.#br#
"This time I will finish that coat! ...or die trying!"

#&7$Lylabell##br#
"Muahahaha! Take that! And that! And this!"#br#
 Lylabell's hands are a blur, and, with inhuman speed,#br#
 she fashions the feathers into a lustrous thread.#npc$$601$$1$0#

#&7$Lylabell##br#
 Lylabell deftly inserts the new thread into the needle,#br#
 and, in next to no time, the coat begins to take shape.#br#

"Good... now for the easy bit!#br#

"Pardon my rudeness. Yes, I am Hans, Lylabell's dear sweetheart.#br#

"Anyway, 
 so long as her imagination runs wild, her work will suffer.#br#
