101|Cleaver|Hoppalong|Cleavers possess enviable strength and unflappable courage.
When one of these cheerful choppers wields his or her signature
axe, enemies can be seen fleeing in all directions!|
102|Salamander|Hoppalong|Salamanders are masters of flame —watch them summon
fire bombs to set the enemy ablaze!|
103|Acolyte|Hoppalong|Acolytes carry a powerful blessing with them wherever they go.
 With sacred hammer in hand, they make a holy mess out of the
servants of evil!|
104|Virtuoso|Hoppalong|They say music soothes the savage beast, but the Virtuoso's tunes
have monsters running for cover. This muse has traps, too.
He brings a whole new meaning to the term "snare drum"!|
105|Strategist|Hoppalong|Strategists use their superior cunning to inveigle the enemy into
 elaborate traps. Their victims are left frightened and defenseless
 when faced with such strategery!|
106|Brawler|Hoppalong|Brawlers are perfect specimens of physical power, specializing
 in bare-knuckled, flat-out, no-holds-barred fisticuffs. Put up
your dukes!|
107|Mystic|Hoppalong|Mystics are finely attuned to the natural world. They're on the best
 of terms with the birds and the bees and can call down thunder and
 lightning to startle unsuspecting pedestrians. Their natural powers
also make them indispensable when it comes to healing all kinds
of nasty bumps and bruises!|
108|Assassin|Hoppalong|Assassins are known to have one-track minds and a penchant for
 recklessness when a target is in sight. While their acumen in the art
 of hurting people makes them great to have around in battle, they
don't make very good guests at most social gatherings.|
109|Zealot|Hoppalong|Zealots are adherents of the Way of the Sword. Apparently, the Way
 involves wielding a weapon three times their own size and smashing
enemies to a pulp.|
110|Sentinel|Hoppalong|The Sentinel's constant vigilance is your best bet when it comes to
setting up secure defensive measures. Halt, evildoer!|
111|Bushi|Hoppalong|Bushi have skill and strength to spare—don't underestimate them
just because of their interminable poise!|
112|Knight|Hoppalong|These knightly heroes are as brave and true as they come. They're
 well-rounded fighters primed with insurmountable offensive and
defensive skills. They're also perfect gentlemen! Who says
chivalry is dead?|
113|Gladiator|Hoppalong|These aces of the arena have been holding out hope for a chance at
 early retirement. Where the heck are the royalty checks from that
eponymous film? Oh, well. Looks like they'll have to stick to kicking
butt for now.|
201|Kiyomi|Fae|This goddess hails from a distant, eastern land and rules
 over the kingdom of night. She's always in search of new
and exciting culinary creations, not least because of the
tremendous energy required for her to maintain human form.
In battle, she summons ethereal forces to surround the enemy
and restore her allies' health.
 |
202|Pandora|Fae|This sorceress came from another world to turn ours into a living
hell. She soon, however, abandoned her evil designs in favor of a
bit of tourism. Her true form is that of a striped gray cat, and though
 she'd never admit it, she loves playing with cat toys when no one
is watching. Pandora is formidable in a fight, calling upon the power
 of elemental magic to cast her enemies into a wintry prison.
 
 |
203|Freya|Fae|Freya, the master of fertility and love, hails from a westerly land.
 Though she originally came to this world in search of someone she
 had lost, she was transformed into a child and can no longer remember
whom she had been looking for. She places a great deal of importance
on outward appearances, which would probably explain why she's so
fanatical about the jewelry and other adornments she wears. On the
battlefield, she taps into seismic energy to restore her allies' health
and improve their critical attacks.|
204|Cindell|Fae|Cindell was wished into existence by an aristocrat who was too lazy 
 to tidy up his own home. She loves cleanliness above all else and won't
tolerate even the tiniest smudge or speck. Once she has pledged allegiance
to a master, her loyalty cannot be broken. Wielding a magical broom,
she sweeps the enemy from the battlefield and uses her skills to bolster
her allies' health and defense.
 |
205|Gabriela|Fae|The angelic Gabriela was sent to earth on a heavenly mission, but the
 music she heard there made her forget all about her original aims.
While she's generally easygoing and peace-loving, her fervent faith
drives her to unleash her wrath on the unholy. In battle, she uses her
 sacred power to boost her allies' health and combat abilities while
 simultaneously demoralizing her enemies.
 
  
 |
206|Flora|Fae|As her name suggests, Flora reigns over the realm of flowers.
 She came to this world to blanket it with blooms, but her powers
were exhausted before the job was through. Now she's only
able to call forth the blossoms that act as her garments. Flora
 has a gentle soul and a tendency to retreat into the safety of
her petals, but she also uses pollen to boost her allies' health and
piercing power in battle.   
 |
207|Gearmaster Garth|Falcon|Garth is a mechanist of exceptional talent. What started as a 
 casual meeting with the Falcon team leader has turned into
a lasting friendship, and Garth is now an indispensable part
of the team. He's as gregarious as he is ingenious, but he tends
to get a little carried away when the conversation gets technical.
It's a fearsome sight to behold when he uses his hammer to
send enemies flying!|
208|Atelia Myrie|Falcon|Although Atelia is world-renowned alchemist, Clear
she's also well-versed in the less controversial fields of biology
and chemistry. Her fellow Falcons are sometimes taken aback
by her barbed sense of humor, but no one complains when she
uses her elemental magic to hobble and weaken the enemy.|
209|Daria|Phantasm|Some girls are cute when they're angry. Some are just intolerable.
You'll have to formulate an opinion about Daria yourself, just don't
 let her know your final verdict. Unless you fancy a good bludgeoning,
that is! Fortunately, she's got the memory of a fish, so she's liable to
forget you said anything—until you push her buttons again for the
umpteenth time. This firecracker's rose petal whirlwinds impair her
enemies' movements before she goes in for the kill.|
210|Esh-Baal|Phantasm|Haughty, hot-headed, and just a little bit hedonistic, this fiery flame of
the Fire Dragon Kingdom bears a striking contrast to her gentle sister
Oriel. Summoning the power of all things hot, humid, and hifalutin',
Esh-Baal stops opponents in their tracks with her inferno-like pyres.|
219|Founder's Spirited Pandora|Elf|This sorceress came from another world to turn ours into a living
hell. She soon, however, abandoned her evil designs in favor of a
bit of tourism. Her true form is that of a striped gray cat, and though
 she'd never admit it, she loves playing with cat toys when no one
is watching. Pandora is formidable in a fight, calling upon the power
 of elemental magic to cast her enemies into a wintry prison.
 
 |
211|Matera|Phantasm|When it comes to all things red hot and sacred, Matera's your sun 
goddess! This sanctified priestess of the great ball of fire in the sky
has just one weakness—a severe case of narcolepsy! Watch out that
she doesn't fall asleep in the middle of your destined duel with the
devil or you could find yourself hung out to dry... or was it fry?
Matera uses the sun's glare to impede enemies while healing her allies.|
212|Valkyrie|Phantasm|Goddess of war, bloodshed, and all things fab and fabulous, this blond
bombshell goes nowhere without her trusty sword and shield... and mirror!
You've never seen a more gorgeous systematic killing machine, and
 you'll be glad she's on YOUR side—just don't mess up her hair! Calling
upon radiant, holy light from above, she weakens the enemy with
just one look before delivering the final blow. Be warned, though—she'll
need ample time to gussy up before each and every battle.|
213|Balestrom|Phantasm|Boy or girl? No one's quite sure when it comes this THIS boorish terror
of the sands. In battle, Balestrom becomes a sand-swept devil the likes
 of which you've only seen in your dreams, but invite them out for a spot
of tea, and you'll discover their unequivocal penchant for all things
pretty, frilly, and covered in lace. Balestrom's skin-raking sandstorms 
restrict their enemies' movements right before their brute strength does
a number on their skulls.|
214|Harmonia|Phantasm|Ever had a song stuck in your head? No doubt, it was the impish
mischief of the goddess of music, Harmonia. Whether you prefer
symphonies or rock concerts, all ditties major and minor originated
from this soft-spoken beauty, and it's been said that hearing her
 performances live will forever spoil the music world for you. She
uses her enchanting voice in battle to disorient the enemy, sapping
them of the will to fight and leaving them open for frenzied
laceration.
 |
215|Luna|Phantasm|Fighting evil by moonlight, this bona fide sailor senshi and goddess
of the moon excels in three things—fighting, hunting, and sleeping
(and she's already done one of those things today, so what's it gonna
be?). You'll have to develop a couple of ingenious motivational
speeches to get her moving, however, as she'd prefer to stay in bed
than actually put any effort into her daily activities.|
217|Little Red|Phantasm|The sweetest, most innocent girl you've ever met, Little Red's crimson 
cloak expertly hides the layer upon layer of her enemies' blood that's
soaked through the fibers. She keeps the head of the Big Bad Wolf at
home on her wall, allowing it to motivate her each and every day. Her

blazing fireballs stop enemies in their tracks before burning them to a crisp.|
218|Dew Elf Droplet|Phantasm|Mio opened his eyes, and again contacted the beginning of this day.
In the personnel have not the world, the only constant is lightweight body and accompany
