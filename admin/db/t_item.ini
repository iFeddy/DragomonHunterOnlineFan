Our ship is now out of sight of land, and the reality of my upcoming adventure is just beginning to dawn on me. I hope you found the note I left. Forgive me for leaving without saying good bye. My family has a long history of tragedy associated with the sea, and I knew you'd never let me go. But it's the only way!
Your grandmother thinks I'm just a good-for-nothing baboon with nothing to offer you but a used banana peel. I'll prove her wrong and earn my fortune! Our fortune... Wait for me, my love. I'll ask for your hand when I return.
            With love, Andy.

708|Andy's 2nd Letter|Dear Lady Amour,
This is our third day at sea, and the smell of the ocean air is invigorating. I've never felt more alive! I'm feeling like a regular old salt already. The two thing I miss most in the world are you and... toilet paper. Somehow I'll manage...
It's said that if you write down your dreams and throw them into the sea, love and the ocean waves will carry them home. I'll give it a try.
            With love, Andy.

709|Andy's 3rd Letter|Dear Lady Amour,
We've now been at sea for a whole week! I'm finally getting used to boat life, as well as the lack of hygienic paper for my rear. I learned the real purpose of the poop deck the hard way. Hopefully my shipmates will forget one of these days... Also, I'm finally getting used to the rocking of the ocean waves and can finally eat dinner without... um...
Well hey, do you remember Richie? He was just a pipsqueak back in Elysium, but he taught me to catch the seagulls that are always circling the cabin. I've had better meals, but we're already running short of food. You'd think we'd have packed more for such a long trip. We'll make do somehow. Plus, thoughts of you are the only sustenance I need.
            With love, Andy.

710|Andy's 4th Letter|Dear Lady Amour,
We've been at sea for only twelve days, but the vast emptiness surrounding us makes it feel like an eternity. We've spotted some large storm clouds on the horizon, and the winds are starting to pick up. The captain just had us batten down the hatches. While I was working I saw rats jumping off the ship. There goes supper.
How can I prepare? I have no idea what I'm doing! Why'd I come to sea in the first place?! We'll just have to weather the storm. I can only pray that this won't be the last letter I send you.

            With love, Andy.

Two weeks at sea! After two days of storms, we've finally spotted the sun again. I heard Davey Jones calling, but somehow I managed to get through. I thank the fates I survived to write you again.

712|Andy's 6th Letter|Dear Lady Amour,
We've been adrift for nearly three weeks. The storm blew us off course. We were due to reach the mainland yesterday, but there's no land in sight. We've barely any food or fresh water left. Everyone is getting on each other's nerves, and my shipmates are starting to drool when they look at me—the plump landlubber! Maybe they know it's my fault the galley's empty. But hey, a man's gotta have his midnight snack!
Only now do I realize how terrifying oceans and shipmates are. I don't regret a thing, though. I'd do it again in a heartbeat just to be with you.
            With love, Andy.

713|Andy's 7th Letter|Dear Lady Amour,
After four weeks adrift on the open sea we've finally been saved! We came upon a merchant ship that not only agreed to lead us to the nearest port, but also to share some of its food and water with us.
I noticed the peg-legged captain quickly stuffing a black flag with a skull on it into his desk. He said it was a flag to commemorate all the poor sailors lost at sea. What a thoughtful man! In five days we'll reach land. Then we'll load up on merchandise and head on home. Once I make my fortune, I'll come back and sweep you off your feet!
            With love, Andy.

714|Andy's 8th Letter|Dear Lady Amour,
It's only been two days since my last letter, but the situation is dire. My shipmates are dropping like flies. It's almost like they've been poisoned! Even our doctor is ill. Only a few crew members, including me, are still on our feet.
We appealed to the merchant ship for help. Their ship doctor said that we were all just too tired, and that we'll be fine after a few days rest.
That didn't make me feel any better. Something fishy is going on...
            With love, Andy.

715|Andy's 9th Letter|Dear Lady Amour,
We've been bamboozled! The merchant ship is run by pirates! How could I have been so blind?! I thought it was just seasickness, but they've poisoned us! The captain got tired of waiting for us to die, so he started making us walk the plank! I slipped away when the pirates were distracted by the screams of my shipmates being devoured by hungry sharks. The thought of you saved me. Now I realize that love is the only nourishment I need. I'm in hiding and still alive, somehow... It's been days since I've eaten, save for a few rats scurrying past my hiding spot deep in the ship's hold. Thoughts of you are all that keep me alive.
But I can't hide forever. Sooner or later, they'll find me. What should I do? I hear some steps approaching... ah! They're... they're coming!
(The letter seems to have been hastily folded and put into the bottle.)
