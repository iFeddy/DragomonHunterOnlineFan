85	Follow him! Don't let that wyvern out of your sight!

103	A shock of electricity ripples through the air... Shockondors! They're everywhere!
104	Take them out before you become bird feed!
105	And thus, the Shockondors would go sailing no more. Take the samples back to Agatha!
106	Go look for swarms of fireflies in Sporefall Core!
107	Venture deep into the marsh and look for Mooncrystal Clusters!

112	This is where you were told to meet. Go find Van Pelt!
113	A mighty roar echoes through the marsh, rippling the water. Bowzar!
114	You'll have to journey further into the abyss to find him!
115	There he is! Bowzar! He's already been pinned down by Agatha!
116	The crystal clusters seem to be reacting with Bowzar's crystalline plates!
117	Bowzar surges with power! You're pummeled by waves of immense energy!
118	Fight alongside your fellow Falcons to fell this beast once and for all!
119	Continue along the path to meet with Atelia Myrie. She'll fill you in on the details!
120	Drive back those rascally Deadeye Moombas to keep them from interfering with the investigation!
121	Head towards the ruined laboratory and meet up with Atelia!
122	Looks like Atelia's already started the investigation.
123	That shell is enormous! How very peculiar. Go check it out!
124	The shell gives a jump! S-s-something's crawling up out of the ground!!
125	Agatha readies her sword to deal the final blow, when all of a sudden, Bowzar begins to glow!
126	Agatha's been awaiting your arrival most ardently. Better hurry along!
127	Cross the muggy marsh to meet up with Atelia.
128	Watch out! There're Fen Croakers everywhere, and they've got a wart to pick!
129	Continue along the path to meet with Atelia Myrie.
130	Atelia begins muttering some sort of hypnotic spell.
131	Protect Atelia from the ribbiting Fen Croakers!
132	Another wave of Fen Croakers to the east! Show them what happens when they mess with Falcons!
133	Another wave of Fen Croakers to the west! Finish them!
134	They're everywhere! It's a veritable Fen Festa! Croak them before they croak you!
135	Whew! Looks like that's the last of the Fen Croakers.
136	It's done! Primordial Crocargot Bowzar is officially no more.
137	Seems Bain is already here. Go rendezvous with him!
138	Make your way deep into the marsh to meet up with Agatha.
139	There's Agatha! But what are all those Serratogator corpses? Better find out what happened...
140	Before you can say anything, you hear footsteps behind you. It's Bain!
141	A poor Dragomon has been caught in the trap! It looks like it's in pain...
142	The Pantherus points its muzzle to the sky with a howl as if to say thank you.
143	The Pantherus looks enraged! It's gonna attack!
144	The strange-looking Dragomon is taken in by Atelia's spell! Now's your chance!
145	All of a sudden, the Dragomon breaks free of the spell and skitters off...
146	Collect three water samples from within the forest.
147	Water sample GET! Now, head to the next spot.
148	That should be all the samples you need. Better bring 'em back!
149	Truly a masterpiece! The Pantherus thinks so, too. As he runs away.
150	Over there! A Greater Pantherus! Get those brushes ready it's time to paint some happy trees!
151	Protect the hatchling White Feldspars by driving away the Pebblepins.
152	Better stop here! Don't wanna get too close...
153	What's that noise?! Sounds like some kind of brawl! Let Van Pelt know!
154	You let Van Pelt know about the nearby quarrel.
155	The Pebblepin slooowly but suuuurely backs off. You can collect the White Feldspars, now!
156	Drive away the Elephant Pebblepin!
157	A Psychosaur notices your arrival and sounds the retreat with a howl.
158	Defeat the Psychosaurs and retrieve those supplies!
159	The rest of the team is already discussing strategy. See what Van Pelt needs you to do!
160	C-... corpses... everywhere! So much blood!
161	Feros calmly crushes bones between its teeth amidst the carnage.
162	Lenora rushes forward to stop the fiend, but is thrown back.
163	Feros rears its head, prepared to attack Lenora again! When suddenly?!
164	It's Nash! And just in time, too...
165	Lenora seems more determined than ever after listening to Nash.
166	Lenora begins casting a spellbinding incantation...
167	All of a sudden, the plants around you start emitting a soft light.
168	It's time! Help Nash keep Feros away from Lenora!
169	A brilliant beam of light bursts forth from Feros.
170	You hear a voice soft and weak, but clear enough to understand. It's Feros!
171	You glance down in surprise you're glowing! And so are Lenora and Nash!
172	Nash's eyes widen in surprise. He must be able to understand, too!
173	No doubt, it's the effects of Lenora's spell.
174	Feros stumbles, shaking his head vigorously as if trying to restrain himself.
175	Lenora's eyes overflow with tears as she puts Feros out of its misery...
176	 
177	Van Pelt steps out from behind a tree and approaches Lenora.
178	Lenora can't keep the tears back and lets out another sob.  
179	You overhear Nash mumbling something about grabbing the Dragocite...
180	He snatches the Dragocite from the fallen Feros and dashes away.
181	Eggcellent! Check the nearby hills for Beakis nests. That's where you'll find the eggs...
182	At last! A Beakis egg! Now to just take it back, and...
183	You glance around to see countless Beakis eyes aimed straight at you, and they're not happy!
184	Get out of there FAST! But watch out for their needlelike beaks!
185	IT'S A STAMPEDE!!
186	Th-the eggs! They're falling! One of the eggs drops to the ground with a crack!
187	There's no way you can continue like this. You'd better leave and report what happened to the guild.
188	Ahh... the breeding season of the intrepid Mothrake. You know what this means, right? Eggs! Everywhere!  
189	A flock of Beakises pokes and prods and prances about the field. How quaint!
190	The Beakises are charging... STRAIGHT FOR YOU!!
191	You're completely surrounded! Find a way out before you find yourself henpecked!
192	We need to find him, Lenora. Before it's too late.
193	Understood.
194	Head towards the meeting spot to find Bain.
195	A flock of Tinderhawks suddenly surrounds you!
196	What was that?! You swear you saw a shadow...
197	Bain rushes forward and breaks through the wall of Tinderhawks.

244	You see Bain run towards you with a shout.
245	He's pointing at something in the bush!
246	A mysterious, masked girl suddenly leaps out! Great scott!
247	Strangely, despite your having no recollection of her, the girl seems to know you.
248	Bain interrupts her colloquy with a biting retort.
249	Unable to take it any longer, he readies his sword and charges towards the girl!
250	The girl leaps out of harm's way in the nick of time. Quite the moves on this one.
251	The girl's shadow suddenly multiples, scattering off in different directions.
252	Perhaps Bain knows what to do...

3752	You hear something just up ahead! Go see what it is.
3753	You finally locate the Falcons. Defeat the Pincerpods and rescue them!
3754	Watch out! More Pincerpods are coming in from the coast!
3755	Agatha: Hey, little Pincerpods... where are you going?
3756	Trapped by an unknown force, you suddenly feel woozy.
3757	The Raptites are closing in, but you can't move...
3758	Unknown Voice: Alright, what type of Dragomon have we trapped this time... Wait, what? A human?!
3759	Unknown Voice: Haha! My trap is truly brilliant! Nothing can escape it!
3760	The mage releases you from the forcefield.
3761	Mage: So you're a Falcon as well? In that case, what's up?
3762	You see Garth as soon as you step off the copter. Go ask him the plan!
3763	That should be everything you need to know. Get trapping!
3764	First trap, set! Now go set the other one.
3765	Second trap, set! You're a natural at this!
3766	That should be the last of them. Go find Garth!
3767	Suddenly, you hear a mighty roar from behind you! Go see what happened!
3768	A cast of Pincerpods is encircling your fellow Falcons! Wipe 'em out before it's too late!
3769	You search every nook and cranny, but there's simply nothing to be found.
3770	From far off comes the howl of a mighty Dragomon.
3771	Bain is standing next to a dead wyvern. Ask him what happened.
3772	where the Falcons were trapped
3773	where Vela and Juneau were attacked
3774	where the roaring noises came from

3782	Keep an eye out for scared Clamcrack Otters!  
3783	There's one! Careful, now. Don't scare it away!
3784	There's one! Use your Trapper Sack to snatch it up.
3785	There's one! Easy, now! Don't be too rough...
3786	The poor otter is overcome with fright and wriggles in your hands, but it soon gives up.
3787	The poor otter is positively paralyzed with fright! It doesn't even resist as you whisk it away.
3788	The otter is enraged and bats at you with its paws. After a short tussle, though, you're able to bag it.
3789	Beat back the hungry Dragomon to save the researchers.
3790	You hear desperate cries for help coming from the village. Hurry!!
3791	No! Bobceratops! Take them out quick!
3792	Defeat the rampaging Stoneskin Mantises so you can collect Sapphire Blossoms.
3793	Use the Sapphire Blossom Powder on any wilting flowers you can find.

3795	Sprinkle it carefully, now!
3796	Sprinkle it carefully, now!
3797	The flower comes to life, blossoming before your very eyes with a brilliant, blue shimmer.
3798	The flower, it's... coming to life!
3799	Liiiiive! Live, my child! Liiiiiive!
3800	Take out those conniving Dragolizards to aid everyone in the hunt for Bowzar.
3801	Bain should be waiting for you! Find him to see what he wants you to do.
3802	Use the meat chop to lure the Marsh Crocoturtles out of hiding...
3803	Perfect! It's all going according to plan...
3804	Here they come! Get ready to bust some heads!
3805	Watch out! Other Marsh Crocoturtles in the area are coming to investigate the situation.
3806	They just keep coming! Bid these gators later!
3807	"An excellent demonstration. I shouldn't have expected any less."
3808	As you enter the forest, you hear the sound of far-off howls. Could this be related to Lenora's disappearance?
3809	The howls are getting louder! This must be the way.
3810	S-stop! You stay away!
3811	Let this little one be!
3812	Oh, why does this always happen to me...?
3813	Just STOP it already!!
3814	I can't... hold out much longer...
3815	Spirits of nature! Hear my... prayer!!
3816	I... I did it...
3817	Lenora!
3818	Upon arriving in Echo Valley, Lenora turns to you expectantly.
3819	Here. Take a few of the Hypnobombs.
3820	You should be able to use them to lull the Ireclaws asleep long enough to pluck a few feathers.
3821	There! It's asleep! Be quick, now! Before it wakes up! The longest, silkiest feather of them all...
3822	That makes two, now. Garth's invention works like a charm!
3823	Perfect. We're making extraordinary time. Only two more after this.
3824	Wonderful! One more should do it.
3825	That should be the last one! Quickly, now! Then we can report back to Van.
3826	The Ireclaw passes out like a lump on a log! Nab one of its feathers... quick!
3827	You and Lenora arrive in Echo Valley only to be greeting by the far-off roars of Grizzlejaws...
3828	I-... I know we've no choice, but I... I don't know if I could bring myself to kill another living being.
3829	We'll... need to split up. Meet me at the end of the valley once you've done your part?
3830	You can hear growls of the Grizzlejaws echoing up ahead. Lenora must be there.
3831	You've driven off the Scarlet Fangsaurs! Time to go meet up with Lenora.
3832	You and Lenora arrive in Echo Mine, ready to attempt your next task.
3833	I-... I don't want to take anymore lives, but I will try my best...
3834	We should probably split up again. It will be faster that way. Come find me when you're done.
3835	You've taken down enough Ironfang Jackals to pass the trial! Now go find Lenora.
3836	You see Lenora going toe-to-toe with some Ironfang Jackals. Help her!
3837	Oh, blessed power of nature! Grant me the strength I need to prevail!
3838	Hungh!
3839	Benevolent... SCORN!
3840	Oh? You're already finished? Commendable, really.
3841	I see now why Van likes you. You can handle yourself.
3842	This time, you head back to Echo Mine...
3843	You hear a crash from behind you. It's... it's an enormous dragon!!
3844	It must have smelled the Ironfang Jackal corpses! It greedily begins crunching on their bones.
3845	Lenora, stay back!
3846	A-a dragon?!
3847	But wait... That scar? That coloring? It... it can't be! Feros!
3848	You're still alive?
3849	Aaaagh!
3850	Nngh!
3851	F-Feros, no! Have you... forgotten me?
3852	No... Feros...
3853	Fe... ros...
3854	The mighty dragon charges towards Lenora!
3855	It opens its mouth, rows of razor-sharp teeth glistening with saliva...
3856	All of a sudden, Lenora radiates a brilliant light, and the earth begins to tremble.
3857	Despite being blind, the dragon can still sense the massive outpouring of energy.
3858	At last it turns away, defeated. You can't even imagine what kind of power Lenora used to drive him off.
3859	For hours you stay by her side, waiting for her to awaken.
3860	As she slowly regains consciousness, you ask worriedly how she's feeling.
3861	Why? Oh, Feros... what have you become?
3862	The Scarlet Fangsaur turns tail and runs upon catching a whiff of the powder.
3863	Could this stench actually act as a repellent?! Use it to help drive them off.
3864	There are more Scarlet Fangsaurs up ahead! Get them out of here.
3865	Keep driving off the Scarlet Fangsaurs!
3866	H-... hello. Here. This powder is yours. We'll have to split up...
3867	Village Entrance
3868	There are still a few Scarlet Fangsaurs wandering around.
3869	Mothrake's Habitat
3870	Delphia asks you to find some Moth Pupae for Lenora. Just... watch out for the Mothrakes!
3871	You stumble to the ground, breaking the pot of powder.
3872	Then, from out of nowhere, a Scarlet Fangsaur charges you!
3873	You're, uh, not sure what to do with the powder? Just try and clear the Scarlet Fangsaurs on your own!
3874	Lenora needs you to gather some Allium Bulbs. But watch out for the Pantherus!
3875	Lenora has been waiting anxiously for you. Go meet up with her!
3876	The Scarlet Fangsaurs flee like cockroaches from a flashlight!
3877	The smell has driven the Scarlet Fangsaurs away!
3878	There should be some pupae nearby. Go take a look-see!
3879	You hear voices up ahead... Get closer so you can eavesdrop on their conversation.
3880	I don't think you understand what I'm saying.
3881	It's Nash and Bain. It seems like they're having an argument probably best not to interrupt them.
3882	You WANT Lenora to hate you?!
3883	What? No, I-... I didn't mean it like that! No one understaaands...
3884	You just asked how to make Lenora treat you like Agatha treats ME!
3885	How else am I supposed to take that?!
3886	I, well, I mean... don't you...? Hmm... Well, you have always been a bit of a clod. A charming one, don't get me wrong!
3887	What the BLAZES are you going on about?!
3888	You mean you really don't know? H-hey! Who's there?!
3889	Nice one, Holmes. There's no use trying to hide anymore...
3890	How much of that did you hear, hm?!
3891	B-barely anything! Really! I was, erm, too far away!
3892	Hmph. Wh-... whatever! I have an Eyedim Dragon to track! Ta-ta!
3893	Nash takes off without a second glance, clearly uncomfortable.
3894	What are you doing here?
3895	I was trying to find Lenora...
3896	...be careful. We still haven't found that dragon, yet. I need to go set up a perimeter, but watch your back, OK?
3897	You decide to begin your search in Echo Valley...
3898	...
3899	Lenora isn't here either. You'd better go deeper into the valley to look for her.
3900	Hnngh!
3901	Hya! Hiii-yah!
3902	You quickly realize that Lenora is only aiming to stun, not kill.
3903	Arh-woooooooo!
3904	The remaining Ironfang Jackals howl, and you suddenly find yourselves surrounded!!
3905	Give 'em heck, Lenora! I believe in you!
3906	You're just about to ready your own weapon when Lenora holds her hand out.
3907	Leave them to me!
3908	Oh, Force of Nature! Grant me the strength I need to prevail!
3909	Lenora chants an incantation... You're not sure why, but it seems familiar.
3910	The Faeflies are listless today... Looks like a great chance to gather some powder!  
3911	Oh! A powderless Faefly?! Just your luck! See if you can find another one.
3912	Another Faefly is down for the count! See if it has some powder.
3913	There's none here either! What's going on? Inspect another Faefly.
3914	Another one! Seems they're dropping like Fae-flies! But does it have any powder?
3915	Nope. None here either. How on earth could this happen? Report back on what you've found.
3916	Inspect the listless Faefly
3917	Inspect the nearby Faeflies
3918	Inspect the listless Faefly again.
3919	Stop! Powder time! Find a Faefly and get powderin'!
3920	It's the same spell Lenora used to get rid of the Pantherus earlier!
3921	"Never fear, my pretties! Your knight in shining armor is here to save you!"
3922	Lenora is suddenly interrupted by an all-too-familiar voice.
3923	In a blast of hot air, the surrounding Jackals collapse in charred heaps.
3924	Weaklings, truly. Look at the way they bow before my superiority!
3925	Nash spins his staff in an elegant circle before flinging his hair back. Lenora, however, doesn't share his joy.
3926	Flames of fury fill her eyes, and her body begins to shake.
3927	You... yooooouuuu!! I HATE YOU!!
3928	Ahhhh-!!
3929	Nash's cries of pain seem to break Lenora out of her trance.
3930	Le... Lenora! It's me! It's... it's Nash! What are you-?!
3931	Nngh...
3932	A-... are you all right?
3933	M-me? I-... hngh... of course! Don't be... don't be silly! I'm perfectly... fine... Never felt... better...
3934	I'll just... talk to you later... nngh...
3935	Nash quickly limps off, holding his side.
3936	Lenora is still clutching her staff tightly in her hand, tears prickling the corners of her eyes.
3937	Let's head back to the Falcon's Nest... OK?
3938	Keep an eye out for the lost boy! Keep your OTHER eye out for Silverspine Ringoons!
3939	Th-the ground! It's shaking so much you can barely stay on your feet!
3940	"Run, Sprocket! RUN! They're gonna blow!!"
3941	Garth's landmines begin exploding one by one! The Ringoons scatter!
3942	"DON'T LOOK BACK!"
3943	"Keep movin, keep movin'! Oh, god! Why didn't I make a remote control?!"
3944	"I mean, it's not like one'd KILL ya. But trust me you'll be walking funny for a few days."
3945	"There, we should be safe now. What're you doin' out here, anyway?"
3946	All right... 
3947	Lenora isn't here. Head to the next area to see if she's there.
3948	Auto-warping to the Wraithwood in:
3949	Auto-warping to Echo Mine in:
3950	Search for Garth, but keep an eye out for the Icecrystal Snappers!
3951	No sign of Garth here. Looks like you'll have to keep looking.
3952	You see a crate of Garth's tools lying on the ground, but he's nowhere to be found. Ask Bain if he knows anything.
3953	Delve into the forest depths,  but be careful not to miss any clues along the way! Lenora's life is in danger!
3954	Chillizards are merciless predators. Watch your back!
3955	You hear the sound of voices ahead. Go see what's happening.
3956	As you clutch your weapon, ready to fight, Lenora shouts to stop you.
3957	Please stop!
3958	The negotiation site is just ahead. Watch your back and be on the lookout for a potential ambush.
3959	The snowscape is suspiciously silent. You feel the hairs on the back of your neck tingle.
3960	Suddenly, you spy your fellow Falcons sprawled across the ground!
3961	You step on a paralyzing trap! You're unable to move!
3962	Muahaha! So, the great and mighty Falcons have  fallen for the simplest trap in the books!
3963	Pathetic! How the likes of you became famous will forever escape me.
3964	Van Pelt stares at the villains in a cold rage.
3965	Van Pelt, despite being paralyzed, uses sheer force of will to charge suddenly at the enemy.
3966	Van Pelt can only defend from one side. Another Dragomon sneaks up on you from behind!
3967	At the last second, the Masked Girl appears out of nowhere.
3968	The Masked Girl knocks down the Dragomon with a single blow, trapping the rival hunters in the blink of an eye.
3969	Her unexpected arrival sends enemies into a panic. Van Pelt takes advantage of the confusion to crush their formation.
3970	Seeing their ranks crumbling, the enemies flee in terror in the face of Van Pelt's cold fury.
3971	You recover from the paralysis. Speak with Van Pelt to discuss what to do next.
3972	Safe Haven
3973	Investigate the Faefly's habitat.
3974	Investigate the Faefly's habitat.
3975	Investigate the Faefly's habitat.

3989	Inspect the listless Faefly
3990	Investigate the suspicious bush.
3991	Is it a trap? You don't know. But after seeing Lenora's bracelet, you have no choice. Bain could be in danger.
3992	You see footprints. Follow them to see where they lead.
3993	Hellooooo? Looks like another no-go. Fate must be somewhere else!
3994	You spy a bunch of rocks and feisty critters, but no Fate!
3995	Bottle filled; duty done. Bring it back to Karen!
3996	Suddenly, the ground quakes beneath your feet!
3997	You find yourself surrounded by Rhinoskers! The smell of the food seems to have made their blood boil! RETREAT!!
3998	You scrutinize the ground, but find no traces of Emerald Amber.
3999	Hmm... there seem to be tiny shards of Emerald Amber in the dirt.
4000	You notice something gleaming through a crack in the ground. That's it! The legendary Emerald Amber!
4001	You hear rustling in the bushes nearby, and it's getting closer!
4002	A... a Hoppalong?! And she seems upset, too!
4003	Upon closer look, you realize it's Fate! She must have gotten lost again.
4004	So THIS is why Lelouch asked you to come here to bring Fate back.
4005	You tell Fate to follow you back to the Transport Station.
4006	That should be enough Vinehorn Ram Blood. Take it back to Omi!
4007	One bug in the bag!
4008	You use the Water Bomb. It's super effective!
4009	Caught like a pro! Keep it up and you'll never have to pay another electric bill!
4010	Almost there! Just two more netfuls to go!
4011	That should do it! Take all the fireflies back to Marvin.
4012	The playful platypus wriggles and squirms in your bag. Hurry! Take it to Karen!
4013	That should be enough, right? Take everything back to Omi!
4014	This should be enough Course Fur. Why not take it back to Mholt?
4015	This should be enough Fresh Spines. Take everything back to Omi!
4016	You search long and hard, but there's still no sign of Fate. Perhaps she's already left? Go let Omi know!
4017	Hunt anymore Wingruses and they'll go extinct! You should go find Lelouch, now.
4018	That should probably be enough, right? Take everything back to Omi!
4019	Excellent work, you kidnapping fiend! Go parade your baby-swiping skills in Michaela's face!
4020	That should probably be enough, right? Take everything back to Mholt!
4021	That should be enough Spiny Claws. Take 'em back to Karen!
4022	Giddyup! You've lassoed yourself a Baby Bobceratops! Take it to Marvin!
4023	Moomba in the breakdown! You've got a Baby Moomba! Take it to Karen!
4024	Eggcellent. You've managed to swipe a Shockondor egg! Take it to Silus.
4025	The flower of romance, Lovers' Bloom, is yours to command! To control! Take it to Michaela.
4026	You've got enough Shockondor Legs to stock a state fair! Take them to Omi.
4027	Bravo! A Marsh Crocoturtle Egg! Mholt will be eggstatic!
4028	You dig and you dig, but there's nothing to be found.
4029	Whelp! Another dead end. No Taelcite here. Try somewhere else?
4030	You dig and you dig, and suddenly... your pick hits stone! The vibrations from the impact rattle your spine.
4031	This must be it! The legendary Taelcite! And it's all yours!
4032	You've got enough Croaker Legs to stock an picerie! Take them to Michaela.
4033	This is where you said you'd meet, but... where's Fate?
4034	You wait and you wait, but Fate is nowhere to be seen. Might as well collect the materials yourself!
4035	That should be everything! But Fate's still a no-show.
4036	You and your ward decide to take everything back to the nearby village.
4037	You've got enough Colorful Daisies to open your own home and gardening center! Take 'em to Michaela.
4038	Whew! That stinks! You've probably got enough Frungus to take to Omi, now...
4039	This must be the spot! A gnarled, bark-less tree towers in front of you.
4040	Despite its lack of bark, it seems to be alive and healthy. Fate's experiment must have been successful!
4041	You should tell her the good news.
4042	You've got enough Soft Shells to rival an aquarium! Take 'em to Mholt.
4043	Great dragon's nostrils, you've caught a Baby Slithering Dragolizard! Quick take it to Omi!
4044	Eye for an eye and tooth for a... well, it's just eyes this time. Take those eyeballs to Marvin!
4045	With jaws like these, you could chomp through iron! Take those jaws of steel to Marvin.
4046	This is where Lelouch told you to go, right? But you don't see anything of particular note...
4047	But why was Lelouch acting so strange? Maybe you should go back and get to the bottom of this!
4048	You've got enough Swampfang Lurker's Tails to open your own lurker-themed restaurant for adventurous gourmets! Bring them to Marvin!
4049	You've got enough Mothrake Scale Powder. Just don't trip, you'll be sneezing for days! Bring it to Omi!
4050	You've got enough Pantherus Fur to start your own fashion line! Bring it to Louis!
4051	You've got enough Ornate Quackadactyl Quills to write your own novel! Bring them to Karen!
4052	Giddyup! You've lassoed yourself a Baby Pantherus! Take it to Michaela!
4053	You've got enough Emerald Plums to start your own plum winery! Take 'em to Silus.
4054	You've filled the glass bottle! Bring it back to Michaela!
4055	That's a pile full o' meat! Take everything back to Omi!
4056	There's nothing here. Try looking for The Great Treasure in other marked areas.

4485	Watch out! Now they're attacking YOU!
4486	The path is blocked. There's no way through.
4487	C'mon, men! Let's clear the path!
4488	The Sealed Sanctuary is just ahead! Only a Dragon Queen can break the seal.
4489	The ferocious Stygian Claw has escaped! Make sure he isn't following us.

4499	You pour the last of the "Holy Water" into the bushes. The flowers instantly shudder, then shrivel up and die.
4500	You paint the ground red with blood. Suddenly, though, you feel someone watching you...
4501	The Rhinoroos are terrified of the opened package. Evade them and get to the next location!
4502	You spot a Rhinoroo just staring at you. This one seems... different.
4503	It follows you in silence. It seems like it wants to follow you back to the village.
4504	You rush over to find John in front of his hut. His skin is streaked with horrible, glossy-red burns...

4513	John's home! It's ablaze! But wait what's the Holy Dragon Queen doing here?!
4514	
4515	There must be some way to return Oriel to her normal self... but how?!
4516	"Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!"  
4517	"Oriel, my dear... It's time for you to rest..."
4518	Wear Oriel down so that Ashar can attempt to stun her.
4519	(Be gentle about it, though, would you?)
4520	"Now! Stop your attack! I shall attempt to stun her!"
4521	Target killed. Quest failed
4522	You carefully move Oriel's body off the main path.
4523	...you have to admit, you hadn't realized just how heavy Oriel was until now...
4524	You've barely glanced at the book and already you begin to feel drowsy...
4525	What's going on? What is this place?
4526	You're still only halfway through the book, but your eyelids feel SO heavy...
4527	Your body feels feverish. The letters on the page seem to be slipping into a soupy blur.
4528	You try so hard to turn the page, but your fingers don't want to move...
4529	You see something flying towards you. Wh-what could it be?!
4530	Just what IS this book? You turn towards the girl to ask...
4531	But before you're able to form the words, you feel a wave of dizziness overtake you...
4532	You open your eyes to find yourself in the strangest city you've ever seen!
4533	How did you get here? And just WHERE is HERE? Why not take a look-see?
4534	Wh-what's this? Humans with... HORNS?! Just what kind of place IS this?!
4535	What's that? Something shiny? THAT'S certainly worth investigating! Head over to the altar quick!
4536	The winged girl before you smiles as though expecting you. Your breath gets stuck in your throat.
4537	She says nothing, however, and simply bows before disappearing in a flash of light...
4538	The Rhinoroos are terrified of the opened package. Evade them and get to the next location!
4539	When the final package is opened, the Rhinoroos start to shriek before scattering in terror.
4540	It's a bloody good time! Sprinkle the blood in the designated locations.
4541	You hear loud voices from just across the bridge! Who could it be?!
4542	"Heeeey! Wake up! You still haven't finished the story, you lazy bum!" An indignant voice breaks you from your reverie.
4543	Wait, the little girl? Elysium? Then, was everything you saw just... a dream?
4544	Your lungs clog immediately with thick smoke, and fiery embers graze your cheeks.
4545	Run to the main village entrance and meet with the Commander.
4546	Regroup and hold back the Shadow Dragon Army together with the rest of the troops!
4547	A portal's opened to the west! Watch out! Incoming Shadow Dragon assault troops!
4548	You've been able to hold them off for now... but the portal's still open?!
4549	A commotion! Not again! Sounds like more troops are on their way!
4550	As the last Shadow Dragon soldier falls to the ground, the portal fizzles into nothingness...
4551	Suddenly, countless portals materialize! War drums thunder in your ears, leaving you dazed and confused!
4552	The beating of the war drums is making you nauseous, and you feel your strength waning...
4553	As your eyelids flutter closed, you hear the sounds of battle gradually recede around you...
4554	You feel a soft touch on your cheek. Where are you? What's happening?
4555	A mighty roar rips through the air! Something's up ahead! Something BIG...
4556	You rush forward, but it's as though lead has filled your legs. You're overcome with a wave of fatigue...
4557	That dragon! That girl! That-... you're not sure WHAT she is, but she looks hurt!
4558	Was it all nothing more than an illusion? Or could it mean... something more?
4559	The sight that meets your eyes is indescribable. It's as though you've fallen through the very cracks of time itself...  
4560	You spot the girl just ahead. Perhaps she has an answer regarding your current predicament?
4561	Suddenly, a brilliant flash envelops the girl so bright, you have to close your eyes.
4562	When you open them again, you find not the girl, but a radiant woman with horns and wings!
4563	You nod your head, determined to aid the queen in whatever way you can.
4564	As the queen disappears from in front of you, you feel yourself enveloped in a soft, white light.
4565	When you come to, the little girl no, the queen is nowhere in sight...
4574	Dragons on the Central Continent? This is practically unheard of!
4575	The wounds appear fresh. They must have been killed recently...
4576	So much blood. The sight makes you nauseous...
4577	Unfortunately for you, the Shadow Dragons saw it! Watch out, 'cuz here they come!
4578	Help subdue Esh-Baal (Reduce her HP to lower than 70%)
4579	Those cretins couldn't hold a candle to you! W-wait! What's that?!
4580	Something's happened at the Volcazar! Back to the citadel quickly!
4581	Oriel lies motionless on the ground, and everyone rushes to her side...
4582	The mighty dragon slowly stills, and you watch as its body begins to shrink...
4583	Calling all craftsmen! C'mon, men! Let's clear the way!

4629	Striding into your ranch, you're suddenly overcome by an atmosphere of tension...
4630	The crazed Whistwater Lurker is ready to pounce! Prepare yourself!
4631	Your heart stops at the scene before you. It looks like something right out of the Enchanted Drachmar Chronicles.
4632	The bow of the ship, however, appears practically untouched...
4633	Watch out! A Wingrus! And it's headed straight for you!
4634	The Wingrus falls to the ground and spits out a strange, crystal bead.
4635	The bead instantly turns to dust...
4636	You investigate the bushes and discover an injured drakeling!
4637	The Hardrock Aerodillo has spotted you! It's about to attack!
4638	The practice battle will begin in 5 seconds. Tighten your seatbelt!
4639	The carving in the altar looks like a spell, but you're unable to decipher its meaning...

4643	You feel a faint tremor beneath your feet...

4646	Panicked Seaspine Gnashers are blocking the path. Clear them out to finish your investigation in peace.

4669	The needle on the gauge stops at zero.
4670	You wait and you wait, but the needle on the gauge doesn't move.
4671	You arrive at the village only to find everyone gathered in a circle. You hope they're not performing a satanic ritual.
4672	You arrive in the Deadlands only to discover Festus and the rest of the villagers strewn about the environs.
4673	You attempt to unleash the mysterious force inside the stone...
4674	Quite suddenly, the stone begins radiating a blinding light!
4675	When you're no longer blinded by the light, you find things the same as before...
4676	You glance about but can find no traces of Enkidu.
4677	Seems he's not here...
4678	You quickly toss the food while Omi's not looking.

4680	Upon closer inspection, you discover a most unusual draconic symbol...
4681	The sudden sounds of a commotion on the shore tickle your ears.
4682	Something's coming!!
4683	The mysterious group Festus had mentioned is just up ahead. Follow them quick!
4684	One of the cult members suddenly ambushes you from out of nowhere!
4685	You can't help but feel those statues are watching you...
4686	No doubt, John was the first human to step foot in Drachmar.
4687	You stuff the blue ore you extracted into your backpack.

4714	Eiko! Wait up! HEY!!!
4715	Nilly, out of breath, runs up to Eiko.
4716	I've been looking all over for you! I knew you'd sneak over here on the sly.
4717	Eiko, caught, doesn't know how to respond.
4718	After a moment, Eiko looks at Nilly and starts to say something.
4719	Before he can speak, Nilly pulls a hatchet from behind her back!
4720	Eiko turns tail and runs away. It's hard to tell if he's more afraid of her anger, or the axe!
4721	"You waited for me," says Eiko, sobbing. 
4722	This should be the place. It's just over that tree-lined bridge.

4749	Find the gift box hidden somewhere in the house.
4750	Go to the orchard, and bring the harvest from there to the pushcart near Leyden.
4751	You feel a rumbly-tumbly beneath your feet...
4752	F-f-flames from the Netherworld?!
4753	Egads! It's Envoliok, the Tarrablast Sandragon!
4754	Suddenly, the world starts spinning, and you feel your legs begin to give out...
4755	When you come to, the mysterious group of people has mysteriously disappeared.
4756	Take the supplies and give them to Jacque.
4757	The Thundyvern emits a brilliant blue light, then instantly turns to dust...
4758	Hunting Race Start: Northern Sea Bridge (Solo)
4759	Hunting Race Start: Maloron Ruins (Solo)
4760	The strange assailant suddenly leaps forward and blocks your path.
4761	A Thundyvern?! It seems to be trapped by that wall of energy!
4762	I-i-it's smashed through!!
4763	You don't like that glint in its eyes as it looks your way... Prepare yourself!
4764	Some sort of strange energy seems to be flowing through the Thundyvern's body.
4765	It suddenly erupts, and the Thundyvern lets out a pained squeal before collapsing.
4766	You can't plant seeds here. Seeding can only be done on raked soil in the orchard.
4767	No seeding area here. Don't waste water!
4768	Leyden: A ferocious Dragomon lies in wait just across that bridge. Don't cross over!
4769	Leyden pulls you back from the foot of the bridge.
4781	The cult members seem to be looking for something. They're skirting around with their heads pointed downwards.
4782	Stay out of sight, and you just might be able to avoid a confrontation...
4783	"E-... enemy attack! Everyone, on the double!"
4784	A nasty Pincer Ant is blocking the path. Only one thing to do!
4785	The bug is squashed and the way is open!
4786	A hungry-looking Ripjaw Shark is blocking the path.
4787	The shark is slain and the way is open!
4788	The strange cult patrolling only a moment ago has mysterious vanished.
4789	You suddenly have the strangest feeling that you're being watched...
4790	Watch out! Ginormous Dragomon dead ahead! Prepare yourself!
4791	Warning! A Toothrus has appeared in the Northern Sea Bridge!
4792	Warning! A Narmatee has appeared in the Northern Sea Bridge!
4793	Warning! A Thundyvern has appeared in the Northern Sea Bridge!
4794	Warning! A Cuspopotomus has appeared in the Maloron Ruins!
4795	Warning! A Spotodile has appeared in the Maloron Ruins!
4796	Warning! An Antlered Browlet has appeared in the Maloron Ruins!
4797	Lelouch: "Esh-Baal, queen of fire, is all that's left. Defeating her will require weapon skills most deft."
4798	Lelouch: "Balestrom, the immortal dust devil, is all that's left. Defeating them will require weapon skills most deft."
4799	You've just crossed Qixi Bridge when the air begins to prickle with an odious energy...
4800	Just as you think you've felled the crow, it splits into two smaller crows!
4801	Could these crows actually be infected magpies?! Hurry and purify them!
4802	Lelouch: "Today's practice may be over, but one's training never ends. Keep sharpening your skills and to mastery you shall ascend."
4803	Pick a bag of fresh fruit.
4804	An anniversary cake has appeared in Fountain Square. Go have a taste!
4805	A referee for the Ultimate Challenge has appeared in Fountain Square. Take him on!
4806	The referee has left. Thanks for taking part, everyone!
4807	You've hooked a special fish! Quick, press "Reel In" in the Action Bar to reel it in!
4808	Challenge complete! Head back to the referee!
4809	The Anniversary Cake has been sliced and eaten. Work together to make another one!
4810	Omi: "Sticky rice! I don't have enough sticky rice! Help me find more!"
4811	Miti: "Meat! Where's my meat?! I need more meat!!!"
4812	Both sides are flaring up their nostrils. They look pretty steamed!
4813	Everyone's working their little tails off. Help deliver the materials they need!
4814	The meeting's going swimmingly. Rest awhile!
4815	"Something's not quite right with the order..." You'll spoil it if you add sticky rice!
4816	Congrats! You've made sticky rice! Add the ground peanuts!
4817	You've completed the BBQ. Leave the rest to Miti!
4818	You already have a ripe pumpkin. Now all you need is unpasteurized milk.
4819	Use the unpasteurized milk to make a creamy pumpkin soup.
4820	You've reached the secret pumpkin pie base! There's an air of mystery to the place...
4821	Collect a ripe pumpkin.
4822	Collect the unpasteurized milk from Billingsworth.
4823	You already have the milk. You can't collect it again.
4824	You haven't accepted or completed "Lv15. Pumpkin Mayhem" today. Maybe you're ready to turn in the quest! 
4825	Please open your backpack and choose "Milk" to make the "Pumpkin Soup." Once you're done, eat it!
4826	Use the "Disguise Mask" to disguise yourself, and then collect candy in the fortress.
4827	Collect the "Creamy Pumpkin Soup."
4828	Go to the "Gourmet's Saucepan" and use the unpasteurized milk to make "creamy pumpkin soup." Eat it all up!
4829	Congratulations on removing the magic. Follow the instructions to make a cute Bat Hat!
4830	Move the Large Egg Meal in accordance with Enkidu's wishes.
4831	You have to accept the quest from Omi before you can move the Large Egg Meal.
4832	After reaching the appointed location, you realize that "Mossjaw" is not actually a human.
4833	You've been discovered by a Terrible Treant. It's charging at you!
4834	After defeating the Terrible Treant, you discover that the Grab Bag was damaged in the struggle...
4835	Too bad. You'll have to report this to Marvin.
4836	The furious Terrible Treant whisks up a whirlwind!
4837	"Wait!" Just as you're about to head out, someone calls for you to halt.
4838	Pant... pant...
4839	Take me with you! I'm anxious about my teammates, too...
4840	But you're injured...
4841	It doesn't matter. Don't underestimate me! I'm responsible for protecting the villagers!
4842	Hmm... all right, then.
4843	But we can't vouch for your safety!
4844	Huh. Don't worry about me. I can take care of myself!
4845	Let's get going, then! Head to the Shadow Dragon Army's camp.
4846	Keep up! To the Shadow Dragon Army camp!
4847	After a while, it's Kukan's turn to keep watch.
4848	Suddenly, Kukan hears a grumbling nearby...
4849	Couldn't even see
4850	...
4851	Is someone there?
4852	...
4853	(Maybe I should go and look...)
4854	Hmm... haha...
4855	Could this be a trap...?
4856	Hmm... something's up ahead...
4857	The earth begins to shudder and shake. The "something" is approaching...
4858	Grrrr... GRRAAAAH!
4859	A Dragomon is roaring behind you!
4860	A Dragomon is charging at full steam! Destroy it!
4861	A silvery laughter resounds from all sides. Your skin is covered with goosebumps...
4862	"Sha... sha, sha..." A rustling sound comes from the grass nearby.
4863	Who... who's there?! Show yourself!
4864	In an instant, Kukan is attacked and knocked unconscious...
4865	Dawn breaks over the treetops...
4866	What happened here?
4867	"Something's not right here..."
4868	Uh-oh... I've been negligent...
4869	Keep it together!
4870	Kukan and Van Pelt are fighting for their lives! Quick, help them!
4871	You manage to save Kukan and Van Pelt. Flee with them to safety!
4872	The sound of footsteps marching in formation approaches.
4873	Hmm... What's that...?
4874	Are those soldiers from the Shadow Dragon army?!
4875	Bain doesn't say a word as he coldly watches the approaching army.
4876	Huh... just the two of you, is it?
4877	Well, no matter. Troops! Listen up!
4878	ATTACK!
4879	Suddenly, the Shadow Dragon army charges at Bain and Agatha!
4880	But strangely, the army charges past them, and heads straight for the village...
4881	What's going on here?!
4882	Despite Bain's best attempts to attack them, the Shadow Dragon troops simply march past...
4883	Clashing sounds can be heard from inside the village.
4884	Soon the whole settlement is engulfed in the flames of battle...
4885	(There's a great pressure weighing down on me...)
4886	Observing that the Shadow Dragon army are ignoring them completely, Bane and Agatha fall into the grips of terror...
4887	Agatha is battling with the Shadow Dragon forces!
4888	Watch out! The Shadow Dragon Gunners have already noticed you!
4889	Dodge the attacks of the Shadow Dragon Gunners and destroy them!
4890	Phew...we're finally done with these tricky customers.
4891	Thanks so much for your help.
4892	But I still have a good friend who's waiting to be saved...
4893	Bain is up ahead. Go and explain the situation to him!
4894	You've saved me! Thank you so much!
4895	I'd love to stay and chat, but I fear time is short.
4896	Your help is needed in the capital. I'll send you there - just step through this portal!
4897	You've come just in time. I'm afraid there's no time for idle chit chat.
4898	The Shadow Dragon Mage is about to summon a powerful Dragomon. We must stop him!
4899	Follow me!
4900	Pomelo is up ahead, trapped in battle! Go and lend him a helping hand!
4901	Fiddlesticks! You think I'll let you get away with this?!
4902	Hahaha! Nervous, are you? That's funny!
4903	What a shame. Unfortunately, you won't make it in time... because you'll all be dead!
4904	Bring it on! Attack!
4905	A Shadow Dragon soldier suddenly appears ahead of you!
4906	Huh? What? How can it be that we, the Shadow Dragon army are...!
4907	Stop being such a baby and just surrender already!
4908	Hah!
4909	"Wow!
4910	"Phew...We finally stopped them...
4911	But now's not the time to rest our laurels. The battle is still raging...
4912	We're running out of supplies, and fast! The supplies that we ordered from the Old Quarter still haven't been delivered.
4913	They must have been intercepted by the Shadow Dragon army. I have to stay at my command post. You look into it!
4914	You can use Monica's Portal to get to the Old Quarter.
4915	I'll leave it to you then!
4916	Everybody! Let's head out! Our brothers in arms are waiting for us to deliver the supplies!
4917	Defeat the Shadow Dragon soldiers to make the portal safe for the Fire Dragon soldiers.
4918	One squadron has already successfully entered the portal! Now you'll have to deal with the others!
4919	All the soldiers have successfully entered the portal! Enter the portal yourself!
4920	A flock of Nautilubi fleeing the putrid fog have blocked the road. Is there anything on the other side?
4921	The putrid fog and the Nautilubi are both gone! Pass through, on the double!
4922	The putrid fog seems to be coming from the flowers to the side. Cut them down!
4923	There's a cloud of putrid fog up ahead. Breathing here will injure you. What are your options?
4924	There's a huge portal just in front of you! Destroy it before the Shadow Dragon army floods through!
4925	Too late!... the Shadow Dragon army is here!
4926	The Shadow Dragon army is pouring through in an unstoppable flood!
4927	The fearsome Dragomon "Phoenixmon" has appeared! Prepare to fight!
4928	"Thundersaurus" flies out of the portal! Prepare to fight!
4929	It's the terrifying "Ancestral Wyvern"! Keep your guard up in battle!
4930	The Portal is broken! But you can still hear Laura's screams coming from the sealed altar...
4931	Castle
4932	Fire Dragon Soldier ahead
4933	Majesty's Square
4934	Sealed Altar
4935	Broken Portal
4936	In the face of the sudden attack, everyone sinks into silence...
4937	Hey you! That's dangerous!
4938	Sky Fort Surroundings
4939	Village Perimeter
4940	You scout around the Sky Fort but don't find anything...
4941	You investigate further in, but don't find anything.
4942	You hear people talking up ahead...
4943	The spot where the Investigation Team was ambushed.
4944	This may be a good place to set up camp.
4945	You look around. The place is too damp. It's not fit for camping.
4946	Before you've found another spot, you hear a peal of laughter...
4947	A strange voice: "Long time no see! Hahaha!"
4948	A strange voice: "What a rare privilege! Did you bring a gift?" 
4949	An angry looking Dragomon stalks out of the shadows!
4950	What a difficult quest! Think of a way to light a fire!
4951	The source of the sound.
4952	The end of the footprint trail.
4953	You've reached the end of the trail of footprints. There's nothing but a dead end ahead.
4954	Eh? But there's nothing here.
4955	"Phoenixmon" and "Thundersaurus" are launching an attack on you!
4956	At the same time, Bain and Agatha are...
4957	In an instant, the Windsong tribesmen surround you...
4958	Ah... Now we're up the proverbial creek without a paddle. Haha.
4959	You're still joking! What's going on here!
4960	It's so quiet.
4961	The familiar silvery laughter breaks out again, raising the hair on your arms.
4962	"Hahahaha!" If you're trapped here until you die of old age, that's pretty inconvenient for me as well..."
4963	In a flash of lightening, the fence in front of you suddenly crumbles.
4964	How... how did that happen?!
4965	What good timing! Someone must be guiding us...
4966	But there's no time to waste wondering who. Let's catch up with the Windsong tribe!
4967	At the same time, over by Kevin...
4968	Shadow Dragon scum! Meet your end!
4969	Use the skill to lead the Windsong tribesmen into battle!
4970	The Windsong Tribe charges at the Shadow Dragon Army, but their attacks are repelled.
4971	Huh. This is really...
4972	It looks like some Windsong tribesmen have been trapped in the village. Go and save them!
4973	Infiltrate the enemy camp and save the Windsong tribesmen!
4974	Hey! Help has arrived! We're saved!
4975	Village Periphery
4976	You! You've got guts, coming in here!
4977	"Alert! There's an intruder!" Kukan screams breathlessly.
4978	A wave of soldiers surrounds you...
4979	Are you the evening's entertainment?
4980	We'd love to play, but it's getting late. Now it's time for you to die!
4981	Xanthus is charging at you!
4982	Defeat Xanthus to protect Sachiel.
4983	You hear Xanthus' mad whispers, but pay him no attention.
4984	Prepared for the worst, you head into the portal.
4985	The moment you defeat Xanthus, the soldiers pin him to the ground.
4986	Just as I thought. Something's not right...
4987	Sachiel's face brightens as if he's just realized something.
4988	Your goal is to delay us!
4989	Sachiel is about to open the portal!
4990	Hey! You're not too bright, are you?
4991	We have to kill you in order to prevent you from returning to the Volcazar!
4992	Xanthus is glowing with unimaginable energy.
4993	Stop Xanthus from interfering while Sachiel opens the portal!
4994	It seems I've underestimated you!
4995	But no matter. It's already too late. Your fate is sealed! Heroes!
4996	Celestial Cliff
4997	You lot stay where you are!
4998	Huh...You're going to have to listen to her?
4999	As Kukan speaks, the sound of his silvery laughter is carried by the wind.
5000	"This is no good at all. You're boring me."
5001	A red Foxy Devil appears out of nowhere...
5002	You okay?
5003	I saw you coming under attack from a ways off. Luckily you're tougher than I thought you were.
5004	That scoundrel! What's he up to now!
5005	He must have something up his sleeve, distracting us like this!
5006	You ask Kukan to be quiet and suggest you head back to the village to survey the situation.
5007	...alright then. Let's head back!
5008	Village Entrance
5009	Warning! The Ancestral Wyvern has appeared in the Celestial Fortress.
5010	Warning! The Phoenixmon has appeared in the Celestial Fortress.
5011	Warning! The Thundersaurus has appeared in the Celestial Fortress.
5012	As soon as you enter the village, you're surrounded by the villagers.
5013	A swordsman in exotic clothing approaches you.
5014	He has a stern, unfriendly look, but at least he's not openly hostile.
5015	I'm sorry to have to use such violent means...
5016	But Kristal has ordered us to prevent you from moving 'freely' around the Celestial Cliff.
5017	Please do me a favor and cooperate... I would prefer to keep this civil without resorting to violence.
5018	Just as the Master is raising his sword, you sense something, and lose the will to fight.
5019	And so, you're locked up together with Kukan...
5020	The guards have left. Now is the time to break through the fence!
5021	But just when you've broken out of jail, you hear a voice calling for help...
5022	It's Kevin! Save him!
5023	Hunting Race start: Solo - Celestial Fortress!
5024	Hunting Race start: Solo - Celestial Cliff!
5025	Warp to the Celestial Fortress after the countdown.
5026	Warp to the Celestial Cliff after the countdown.
5027	Kukan is inside! Forge ahead and get him out of there!
5028	Once you enter the village, you see Wanda pinning a Skyrock tribesman to the ground.
5029	Phew...these wretches are crazier than I thought...
5030	I saw what you did just now. Have they both been saved?
5031	Let's leave here as well.
5032	"Hang on a minute," says a clear voice.
5033	The swordsman in the colorful costume reappears.
5034	You ask Bain to leave, telling him that you'll deal with the situation.
5035	Ah... Clash of the titans? It's a bit of a clich, but I'm down.
5036	With this pronouncement, Wanda rushes out of the village.
5037	I should have prevented her from taking off... but I was impressed by your resolve.
5038	Your bravery will not have been in vain...I will give this my all!
5039	The Master raises his blade. His attitude is quite different now! Defeat him!
5040	Your savage attack knocks the master unconscious. Escape now while you can.
5041	Katya raises his weapon and charges towards you!
5042	A rare Dragomon has appeared in the Celestial Fortress! Find and defeat it!
5043	A rare Dragomon has appeared on the Celestial Cliff! Find and defeat it!
5044	A Beemoth is devastating the ecosystem of the Celestial Fortress. Defeat it immediately!
5045	A Beemoth is devastating the ecosystem of the Celestial Cliff, defeat it!
5046	"Huh... It seems I underestimated you..."
5047	A beam of light fizzes past you and Katya disappears before your eyes...
5048	You suddenly feel dizzy. A soft and familiar voice sounds in your ear.
5049	"I have no fight with you..."
5050	"But you're interfering with our project..."
5051	It looks like a barrier of sorts...
5052	But it's still possible to escape. That pillar up ahead seems to be supporting the barrier. 
5053	Destroy the pillar and the barrier will disappear.
5054	But the barrier's master will try to prevent you with his magic. It won't be easy.
5055	Dangerous work is your specialty, though. Do your best!
5056	A troop of lifeless soldiers appears on the scene...
5057	Although they don't look primed to attack, you can't let them have free reign...
5058	Destroy the Pillar
5059	After the pillar is destroyed, the barrier begins to shake...
5060	You are plunged once again into darkness...
5061	Warning! The Wigdeer has appeared on the Celestial Cliff.
5062	Warning! The Charcowl has appeared on the Celestial Cliff. 
5063	Warning! The Rocksand Dragon has appeared on the Celestial Cliff. 
5064	Midori's energy starts to ripple... watch out!
5065	Midori can no long fend off your attacks, and loses consciousness...
5066	Defeat Midori
5067	Defeat the Master
5068	Defeat Katya
5069	Deep Behind Enemy Lines
5070	Deep behind enemy lines, you find a Rattlesnake Fang soldier.
5071	Kukan has joined the ranks of the Rattlesnake Fangs. Ask him how that happened.
5072	Huh...looks like Midori failed as well...
5073	Now it's time for Pyerrot to put in an appearance.
5074	Billows of smoke rise up from beneath Kukan's feet...
5075	Behind a screen of smoke, Kukan seems to be undergoing a transformation.
5076	After the smoke disperses, you see a young girl dressed in a very strange ensemble.
5077	You see Hamiya walk ahead. A reflex tells you to charge forward, but you're frozen on the spot. 
5078	Hm... Hamiya glances at you, and smiles before turning away again.
5079	Hamiya focuses a red light on the center of a boulder...
5080	Its starts to pulsate with energy...
5081	Suddenly a portal appears out of nowhere!
5082	"Eh? He's using the power of the Dragon Queen."
5083	I hadn't though that establishing the coordinates would be so easy. I was hoodwinked.
5084	The Leadshale Rogue Master suddenly appears. You can't help but feel confused.
5085	Inside the Portal
5086	"Stand still!" Wanda shouts, and runs over panting.
5087	A energy envelops Wanda.
5088	You immediately recognize the energy. It must be emanating from the Dragon Queen!
5089	If that's how it is, then that's how it is.
5090	"Intruder of the sacred Windragon Realm! In the name of Zephyra, the Wind Dragon Queen, I sentence you to death!"
5091	Just has Zephyra is about to be defeated, she flees to the horizon in a flash of light.
5092	Zephyra starts to gather even more powerful energy...
5093	Oh?!
5094	Zephyra loses consciousness after being hit with the wave attack.
5095	You're surprised to discover that Fritz is absorbing the energy from the seal!
5096	You urgently ask Fritz why he's destroying the seal. Doesn't he want you to know the truth?
5097	Well, who can say?
5098	Isn't that rather wishful thinking?
5099	Didn't I say that I need the energy from the seal?
5100	You can sense Fritz's ill intent. Take up arms and stop him!
5101	Ah! This should be fun.
5102	You humans are shameless and greedy. It's time I put an end to you.
5103	A purple gas spreads out like an exotic flower.
5104	The pink gas is sweet and flowery.
5105	The blue gas is as mysterious as the sea. Prepare to enter a battle of unknown stakes.
5106	You've reached the warzone, but can't spot anything of note...
5107	You look at the fishnet, but all you see is the water lapping up against it.
5108	Beneath the net, shoals of fish are floating leisurely through the currents...
5109	Suddenly, a flash of light illuminates the net. Curious, you pull it out of the water...
5110	I want to thank you for saving me the trouble of setting up the portal coordinates. You did well.
5111	Seeing as you've completed the quest, shouldn't you... take a rest'?
5112	A bolt of lightning strikes down all the Rattlesnake Fangs.
5113	Several giant swordsmen appear behind Fritz...
5114	You use the shovel at the designated location and, to your surprise, dig up a pile of shards.
5115	You use the shovel at the designated location. There's a flash of lightening, but you can't find anything.
5116	You use the shovel at the designated location. A strange hologram appears. Something is going to happen...
5117	You take the injured Drakeling back to the village.
5118	Uh oh! I need your help! Follow me!
5119	There's no time to explain! Come with me!
5120	Is it that urgent?!
5121	Shucks... but I just... oh, alright then! You go ahead. I'll catch up with you!
5122	Head in the direction that Wanda went, and catch up with her!
5123	You can sense that the Shadow Dragon army is patrolling nearby. They seem to be looking for something.
5124	Spray the "Unknown Herbicide" onto the large tree and see what happens.
5125	Plant the "Budding Plant" in the village.
5126	Plant the "Thriving Plant" in the village.
5127	Plant the "Blossoming Plant" in the village.
5128	Down the "Energy Drink" to get more energy.
5129	"Rwwwooaarrrrr!!!"
5130	Huh. Not so impressive for the so called Sealed Sanctuary. There's not the slightest trace of a living creature.
5131	I'm going to plunge right in. You should hurry up.
5132	Defeat the Sentinels to continue moving forward!
5133	Mysterious Location
5134	Mysterious Location
5135	Mysterious Location
5136	Under the succession of shocks, you don't quite manage to react in time...
5137	But seeing the Fire Dragon Queen and the Wind Dragon King leave, you are far from dispirited. You even feel cheered.
5138	Darn...It's almost as if they knew we were coming to attack...

15194	You've already used this item.
16001	Hey, pal! I'd love to start cookin', but I'm gonna need some ingredients!
16002	Gotta give old Pelt a grand farewell. TTYL! TTYL!
16003	I can't use that AGAIN! A master chef must challenge his repertoire! Bring me something else!
16004	This is the moment I've been waiting for! What'll it be, boss-man?
16005	Ingredients are present and accounted for! What'll be be, boss-man?
16006	I've just discovered a new recipe! It's gonna knock your socks off!
16007	This dish is for cowards! You little, baby, chicken wimp!
16008	This one, huh? Nothin' wrong with that! Unless you like serving your mons the same thing every day!
16009	This one's SO easy... C'mon! I live for a challenge!
16010	I just made this yesterday! Apparently, Marvin snuck a taste and ended up glued to the porcelain throne! That old kook.
16011	This one? It's a toughie, but I should be able to manage!
16012	Ohoho, this one? Comin' right up, boss-man!
16013	Ohoho! Good choice! Only a master chef could pull this one off! It's all about subtlety!
16014	Not bad! This happened to be a favorite of mine a few years back.
16015	This one LOOKS easy, but appearances can be deceiving! Can't make a single mistake!
16016	What a coinky-dink! Louis ordered this yesterday! He's always begging me to make it for 'im.
16017	This one's fresh off the press! Kinda hoped you wouldn't choose it, but... hey! The customer is always right!
16018	This one's a real whizbang! You're, uh, sure this is what you want?
16019	This one's easy! But it does take some time... Stop rushing me!
16020	It'll be done when it's done! Just gimme another sec.
16021	No matter the recipe, Omi shall cook it readily Ye must have patience! 
16022	Tra la la... powdered antennae, Dragolizard scale... and just a touch of bile!
16023	Shush! Be quiet! This is a crucial point in the cooking process...
16024	Smell that heavenly bouquet! It's almost ready!
16025	Keep your shorts on! Top-quality food takes a while to prepare!
16026	How about... five hairs from an ape's mane? Or perhaps some Treant beard for extra oomph?
16027	What's this color?! Did I forget the croaker skin?! I'll add a bit more...
16028	Haha! Perfect! Great success!
16029	What? It looks weird? Never you worry, friend! I just haven't added all the ingredients, yet!
16030	Stop! Don't come any closer! This dish is dangerous! It could, uh, get a little sticky...
16031	Voil! It's finished! Quick, quick! Eat it while it's hot!
16032	So sorry for the wait! Your food is done!
16033	And it turned out GREAT, to boot!
16034	I know, I know... you wanna dig in, don't you? But this is for your Dragomon!
16035	This is.... PERFECTION!
16036	I can't believe it turned out this well! Your Dragomon'll go ga-ga!
16037	Hard for some, but not for me! That's why my name's Chef Omi!
16038	I KNEW this one'd be tough! But I pulled it off... just barely!
16039	A thousand failures... all for a single success! Look at that COLOR!
16040	The rich color! The alluring fragrance! THIS. IS. FOOD!
16041	What's this? What's this? Such an exquisite dish!
16042	My culinary artistry surprises even myself sometimes!
16043	There are no Dragomon... ready for breeding...
16044	Dragomon can't breed until they're in the mood...
16045	It looks like one of them... is getting there, though...
16046	There's only one Dragomon that can breed... at the moment...
16047	A lot of them can breed...
16048	It's breeding season... for most of the Dragomon...
16049	It's a little shy... Be quiet, no talking...
16050	You have to be careful... This one's very sensitive...
16051	This one's well-behaved... Perfect for breeding... I'd say...
16052	Not to worry, this one is... pretty meek...
16053	There's nothing special... about this one...
16054	It's in good health with... no apparent personality problems...
16055	This one's a little ornery... Think twice... before selecting it for breeding...
16056	I'd think carefully before choosing such a... restless Dragomon for breeding...
16057	It's aggressive... Are you sure you want this one...?
16058	Be cautious, it's pretty aggressive...
16059	They don't get along... They'll just fight...
16060	They don't like each other...
16061	They'll probably just fight...
16062	They're not a good match. They probably won't breed...
16063	There's an age difference... They might be infertile...
16064	This is its first time breeding. There's no guarantee of success...
16065	They're both just the right age...
16066	They get along famously...
16067	They're doing well... Ideal breeding material...
16068	They've taken a liking to each other. The breeding should go smoothly...
16069	Their species and age are perfect for breeding...
16070	These two... should produce a thoroughbred....
16071	What a shame...
16072	Failure is... a part of life...
16073	A baby... has been born...
16074	What a cute baby...
16075	Failure is... the mother of success...
16076	Who knows... what will happen... 
16077	A nice, healthy baby...
16078	It looks like its parents...
16079	Don't give up...
16080	I'm sorry... The breeding was a failure...
16081	Congratulations... It looks healthy...
16082	The baby... has its mother's eyes...
16083	Hey, you! Your ranch is under attack and you're standing around with your head in the clouds!
16084	Hey, aren't you gonna come collect your reward? Huh? Huh?
16085	Hey, you! Your Dragomon's been injured! Don't forget to treat the poor thing!
16086	Why're you dawdling here with me, huh? Go take care of your Dragomon! Some of 'em are injured, y'know!
16087	Boring, snoring! I've been standin' around all day! I want something to HAPPEN!
16088	What are you, some kinda sadist?! That little guy's injured already!
16089	This poor, unfortunate soul! Let it be! LET it BE! Its life is... bleeding away!
16090	Choose a Dragomon! Any Dragomon! Get ready to d-d-d-defend!
16091	This Dragomon is powerful, sure, but it's also a gentle giant! Not sure how much good it'll do ya.
16092	This one, huh? Meh. Pretty so-so. Guess it's not a BAD choice...
16093	This is one ornery fella! Watch out he might pick fights with the other Dragomon!
16094	This guy's a monster! You let him into the pasture, and he might gobble everyone else up!
16095	If that's all you can manage, you might as well let your Dragomon go, already!
16096	C'mon! C'mon! Step it up a notch! Hey! That's Dragomon abuse! Stop forcing your mons to fight!
16097	Huh. Well, it's not the best fighter, but I suppose it's not TOO bad...
16098	This guy's no good in a fight! You better bring along your first-aid kit!
16099	Seems pretty so-so. Not a champ, but not a loser, either!
16100	Nothing extraordinary to report here! But, hey, if you're okay with that, go ahead...
16101	This guy packs a punch! Probably a good choice.
16102	Ohoho, this one's a big galuga! Sure, it might not be able to tackle everything, but no one's perfect, right?
16103	This one should at least be able to stop the varmints in their tracks!
16104	Ohoho, doomed! The enemy is DOOMED with this guy keeping watch! Bring it on!
16105	This guy's a grade-A powerhouse! Nothing stands a chance against this kinda muscle!
16106	If you're looking to manufacture something, I won't be able to help you on the material front.
16107	No materials, huh? So, you've just come by for a chat? I feel so honored!
16108	Sorry, we're closed! I gotta be up bright and early if I want to sell my potions!
16109	Looks like you've got a few valuable items here.
16110	Ah! This could be turned into something very nice! Good work!
16111	Welcome to my manufacturing shop.
16112	It's impossible! But you'll still have to pay!
16113	You might have more luck with alchemy. Go see Atelia. That'll be 5 gold for the information.
16114	Hmm... It's a gamble! There are no refunds if you lose!
16115	We care about your wallet!
16116	Want to take a shot? Then show me the money!
16117	(Marvin flips a coin... It's heads!) Show me the money!
16118	(Marvin flips a coin... It's tails!) Show me the money!
16119	The material seems compatible, however there may be a few blemishes.
16120	I should be able to do something with this.
16121	This should be worth doing!
16122	Based on my extensive experience, I predict the success rate will be high.
16123	Everything I need is here. There's just one important element missing... money!
16124	There are both great risks and great rewards in the manufacturing industry.
16125	We'd be grateful for any contribution you could make.
16126	Done! We're the world's best manufacturing shop!
16127	Voila! It's finished! Thanks for your business.
16128	Failure would be money down the drain!
16129	Failure would be money down the drain!
16130	The quality's actually not half bad!
16131	Done! Next.
16132	There may be a few small blemishes but... huh? Broken!
16133	It's not my fault! The problem's with the material!
16134	Where there's money, there's a way! That's my motto!
16135	Integrity is our top priority!

45195	#3$$1#Quiet down! I need to concentrate!
45196	#826$$1#Traps are weapons, too! Well... weapons that let you avoid real weapons, am I right?
45197	#831$$1#Don't underestimate the benefit of a well-placed trap!
45198	#826$$1#Marvin is a huge fan of my traps. He takes a few every time he sees me. I wonder what he's up to...
45199	#831$$1#I love to read. Being able to think outside of the box is very useful when developing a battle strategy.
45200	#827$$1#

45207	#821$$1#We Hoppalongs are always happy to help people!
45208	#821$$1#So, what would you like to talk about? Tell me.

45210	#826$$1#Fate is always asking me if there's some medicine that will cure her horrible sense of direction. What do you think, %n%? A lost cause?

45213	#826$$1#I consider myself the strong, silent type.
45214	#826$$1#Ambushing the enemy from behind is the best way to maximize your damage. There's nothing dishonorable about that, right?
45215	#826$$1#Ambushing from behind is a tricky skill to master. Most people just don't understand the technique.
45216	#826$$1#Marvin always brings grown-ups and children to see my performances, then smiles happily to himself backstage. It's kind of creepy, if you ask me.
45217	#822$$1#Marvin's latest toy is the inspiration behind my latest stabbing technique.
45218	#821$$1#Karma is what keeps the world together.
45219	#3$$1#I'd like to master the sword in my spare time. Any tips?
45220	#831$$1#Tough guys like to get up close and personal. They're too dense to understand the subtlety of an assassin.
45221	#824$$1#I love using a sword!
45222	#822$$1#I've got a hankering for some of Omi's delicious food... Can you cook, %n%?

45251	#822$$1#I'm in the mood for something musical right now, but thanks for the thought!
45252	#826$$1#I'm still enjoying your last gift. Why don't you give me something a bit later?
45253	#826$$1#I'm busy practicing. Why don't you come back later?
45254	#822$$1#I don't need anything right now. All systems are go!
45255	#823$$1#Sorry, could you be a little quieter? I'm trying to concentrate.

45288	#831$$1#This is just the thing I've been looking for! Now I'll be able to make that trap that Garth's been after.
45289	#824$$1#I couldn't be happier! My head is overflowing with ideas for cunning new Dragomon traps!
45290	#824$$1#I've got the perfect thing in mind for this!
45291	#826$$1#Not especially fond of this, but I suppose it'll do. Thanks...
45292	#826$$1#This doesn't seem very sturdy. It's not really what I've been looking for.
45293	#826$$1#Not the first thing I'd choose, but it's the thought that counts, right? Thanks!
45294	#826$$1#Even if someone doesn't like a gift, it's the thought that counts.
45295	#822$$1#This could prove useful in a fight.
45296	#824$$1#Oh! This is just the ting I've been looking for! How delightful!
45297	#826$$1#Not especially fond of this, but I suppose it'll do. Thanks...
45298	#825$$1#Did you do this on purpose? Mystics aren't healers, you know.
45299	#826$$1#Not the first thing I'd choose, but it's the thought that counts, right? Thanks!
45300	#822$$1#I'd usually pass on something like this, but as it means so much to you...
45301	#824$$1#Wow! This is super-rare, isn't it? I've been dreaming about something like this forever!
45302	#824$$1#Oh! I wonder if this could bring me back from the dead?
45303	#826$$1#Not especially fond of this, but I suppose it'll do. Thanks...
45304	#823$$1#Hmm, maybe I should put %n% on my... list... 
45305	#826$$1#Not the first thing I'd choose, but it's the thought that counts, right? Thanks!
45306	#826$$1#This is an assassin's most important skill.
45307	#831$$1#Oh! I could develop a deadly new weapon with this!
45308	#831$$1#I'm bursting with energy! Other Hoppalongs are no match for me!
45309	#826$$1#Not especially fond of this, but I suppose it'll do. Thanks...
45310	#825$$1#I guess I should learn to be happy with what I've got.
45311	#826$$1#Not the first thing I'd choose, but it's the thought that counts, right? Thanks!
45312	#826$$1#Ah... no! Brawlers like us like to maintain an air of stoicism. Letting your emotions run wild is a sure way to lose a fight
45313	#822$$1#Terrific! I can already feel myself getting stronger!
45314	#822$$1#I have the feeling that me and %n% will be friends for life.
45315	#826$$1#Not especially fond of this, but I suppose it'll do. Thanks...
45316	#821$$1#
45317	#826$$1#Not the first thing I'd choose, but it's the thought that counts, right? Thanks!
45318	#821$$1#
45319	#821$$1#
45320	#821$$1#
45321	#826$$1#Not especially fond of this, but I suppose it'll do. Thanks...
45322	#821$$1#
45323	#826$$1#Not the first thing I'd choose, but it's the thought that counts, right? Thanks!

45336	#821$$1#
45337	#821$$1#
45338	#821$$1#
45339	#824$$1#I could really go for a hearty stew...
45340	#831$$1#When I'm bored, I usually think about food.
45341	#1$$1#(Stares blankly off into space...)
45342	#3$$1#Why do I feel so lazy some days?
45343	#823$$1#Uh... Did you call me?
45344	#825$$1#%n%, have you seen my kitsune?
45345	#826$$1#Matera is always telling me I eat too much... What do you think, %n%?
45346	#821$$1#Whenever we finish eating, Cindell runs over to clean up after us! Isn't she the greatest?
45347	#831$$1#%n%, have you heard of the Kingdom of the Night?
45348	#827$$1#Oh... I'm famished...
45349	#827$$1#My poor tummy is rumbling!
45350	#831$$1#Do you know anything that will satisfy my hunger...?
45351	#824$$1#If you want me to keep talking, give me food!
45352	#831$$1#Actually, I'm not much of a talker...
45353	#823$$1#I think my voice needs a little work.
45354	#825$$1#The last time someone from the Hunter's League spoke with me, he called me "Miss!" He must not have known that I'm a goddess...
45355	#3$$1#Why am I always so hungry...?
45356	#826$$1#To tell the truth, I am partial to %n%...
45357	#826$$1#Even though I don't say much, I appreciate the fact you understand...
45358	#831$$1#I can't accept your gift...
45359	#827$$1#Why have you been acting so cold lately?
45360	#825$$1#Do you really think a gift like this is appropriate?
45361	#824$$1#Food is the best medicine!
45362	#822$$1#Perhaps you're smarter than you look!
45363	#823$$1#The taste! It's to die for...
45364	#824$$1#This is bliss! I'm so embarrassed...
45365	#822$$1#Meow!
45366	#825$$1#Clean cats don't need washing!
45367	#831$$1#I may be small, but my magic packs a punch!
45368	#831$$1#%n%, do you think I've got what it takes to be a sorceress?
45369	#821$$1#I love my Fae sisters! One's always eating and one's always sleeping, tee-hee!
45370	#821$$1#I love to tease people, tee-hee!
45371	#824$$1#While Matera was sleeping, I doodled all over her face. She woke up and went right out without realizing! Hahaha...
45372	#821$$1#Kiyomi's kitsune is sooooo cute! I want one... Maybe she'll trade it for a bowl of soup, tee-hee!
45373	#831$$1#I'm so bored. I really want someone to play with...
45374	#821$$1#Do you really want to know what's in Pandora's box?
45375	#821$$1#This world is full of new and unusual things just waiting to be discovered!
45376	#827$$1#Hey, %n%! I'm too cute to just ignore! Yoo-hoo! Over here!
45377	#821$$1#Can you guess what's in the box, %n%? Nope, guess again! Do you really wanna know? Well I'm not going to tell you! Tee-hee!
45378	#825$$1#Gabriela is clearly crazy. Why do so many people like her?!
45379	#831$$1#Please don't talk about Gabriela around me.
45380	#825$$1#I can't stand Cindell! She always complains when I turn into a cat, says it's dirty. The nerve!
45381	#3$$1#In my old home we had a bunch of ancient books. I used to read them for inspiration.
45382	#825$$1#Gabriela is the worst! She's such a pretty little liar. And she calls herself an angel... hmph!
45383	#824$$1#Even though I may seem like a rough-and-tough kinda gal, I actually love to cuddle up with a good book!
45384	#826$$1#I just want to cuddle up with my cat!
45385	#825$$1#Hmph! Even the family dog wouldn't touch this!
45386	#831$$1#Nothing special... why should I accept this?
45387	#825$$1#It may sound a bit cruel but... I love teasing the cat. 
45388	#822$$1#Hmm, not bad! I'll let you pet the cat! Just once, though...
45389	#825$$1#Let me know if anyone bullies you, %n%. I'll show them a thing or two...
45390	#822$$1#You're one of the most caring people I've met, %n%. I'd love to go on an adventure with you!
45391	#825$$1#I can't stand confrontation. Why can't everyone just get along?
45392	#831$$1#When I'm feeling down, I look towards the beauty of nature to brighten my mood.
45393	#821$$1#Spring is my favorite season. It's the time for new beginnings!
45394	#821$$1#I love to wander in the countryside. Why don't you take me out more, %n%?
45395	#825$$1#Although I abhor violence, I'll never forgive those who hurt Mother Nature!
45396	#826$$1#Pandora and Cindell are always at each other's throats. Why can't they just get along?
45397	#3$$1#You've looked so tired lately, %n%. Here are some tasty treats to brighten your day!
45398	#826$$1#Matera came to visit yesterday. She dozed off and fell into the pond! Classic Matera!
45399	#821$$1#Mother Nature should be cherished, not destroyed!
45400	#826$$1#Why is everyone always fighting? Why can't we all just be happy and get along?
45401	#822$$1#Daria looks like she's got a lot on her mind. Maybe you could cheer her up, %n%?
45402	#825$$1#I really hate the fact you go out and kill every day, %n%. What if you get hurt?
45403	#824$$1#You have a noble heart, %n%. I think that's why we get along so well.
45404	#821$$1#The last time I was in Cain's Glade, I saw an amazing plant! I'd love to get my hands on it.
45405	#831$$1#If you're rude, you won't get your gift!
45406	#822$$1#I wish you would take me out more often, %n%. I'd love to experience the beauty of nature with you!
45407	#3$$1#Reading is so relaxing. Don't you agree, %n%?
45408	#824$$1#I really like you, %n%. You're the ideal hunter!
45409	#823$$1#Thanks for always being there, %n%. It makes me so happy!
45410	#831$$1#Being overly pampered isn't healthy....
45411	#825$$1#We're like complete strangers. Neither of us has a clue about what the other likes.
45412	#827$$1#How lucky could I be?!
45413	#822$$1#You're beginning to understand my sense of taste, %n%. You're a great friend!
45414	#821$$1#I accept... I think.
45415	#824$$1#%n%How did you know I liked this? Simply adorable!
45416	#2$$1#You always give me the coolest things, %n%. You're the best!
45417	#2$$1#Wait, Master! Let me clean up a bit first!
45418	#3$$1#I like to keep things neat and tidy for Master...
45419	#2$$1#(continues to sweep the floor...)
45420	#831$$1#You can see from my outfit... I have a soft spot for sweeping!
45421	#826$$1#Hmph... I'm bored! I wish I had something to clean!
45422	#821$$1#If you have time, Master, could you find a new broom for me?
45423	#825$$1#Pandora is soooo annoying. Every time she shows up, the house is covered with cat hair!
45424	#831$$1#Look at this special feline shampoo I just found! Now where's Pandora...
45425	#827$$1#%n%Have you seen my broom? I've no idea where it went!
45426	#826$$1#So much to clean, so little time. The whole world needs tidying!
45427	#827$$1#Can you leave me at home when you head to the marsh, %n%? I can't stand the smell!
45428	#825$$1#Although I like you Master, I'd rather not wash your smelly socks every day...
45429	#827$$1#I've had so many chores to do lately, my poor hands are aching...
45430	#822$$1#%n%! If you see a nice broom at the auction, be sure to buy it for me!
45431	#826$$1#Don't always assume I'm depressed, %n%!
45432	#821$$1#Master! Marvin has a new detergent in stock! Can you pick some up for me! It's super-cheap, just 5,000 Gold!
45433	#831$$1#Master, please remember to keep the place clean and tidy or I'll have to sweep you up too!
45434	#823$$1#%n%, don't assume that sweeping is all I think about...
45435	#824$$1#What I'd like most is something that can make the world a cleaner place...
45436	#822$$1#Thank you Master, but I don't need this at the moment.
45437	#825$$1#Dirt and grime are my worst enemies!
45438	#2$$1#I'm going to give the place a good sweep! Put that there for now!
45439	#822$$1#Thank you Master. It's not exactly what I was looking for, but I'll take it anyway.
45440	#826$$1#Cindell is such a good-natured, hard-working girl!
45441	#824$$1#Such a wonderful gift, I'm touched! I'll treasure this forever!
45442	#824$$1#Whoa! Master, this gift is terrific! I love it!
45443	#821$$1#Who doesn't love Gabriela?
45444	#822$$1#If you want to listen to my performance, you have to buy a ticket. No exceptions!
45445	#824$$1#I'm the one and only Gabriela!
45446	#825$$1#I can't stand Pandora! Every time she turns into a cat, she grabs my hair!
45447	#831$$1#Freya's cookies are totally delish!
45448	#826$$1#Matera said she saw me sleepwalking. How come I can't remember anything?
45449	#831$$1#If both Pandora and I were drowning and you could only save one... who would it be? You better answer correctly!
45450	#825$$1#Why don't I like Pandora, %n%? Because she always scolding me!
45451	#822$$1#%n%! Do you like my curly blonde hair? It's super-cute and all the rage now!
45452	#831$$1#The music of heaven is simply divine, %n%! Don't you agree?
45453	#827$$1#Do you love me, %n%? If you do, then how about some pocket money?!
45454	#824$$1#Pandora... hmm... who? I don't know who you're talking about, tee-hee!
45455	#824$$1#You're really good to me, %n%. What would I do without you?
45456	#821$$1#My fans are my life! I'd be nothing without them.
45457	#821$$1#Do you hear that divine melody, %n%?!
45458	#827$$1#I saw a great saxophone in Marvin's store yesterday. I'd love to buy it, but I don't have enough money. Say, could you do me a favor?
45459	#821$$1#I wonder why I'm always so thirsty after a performance...
45460	#823$$1#New orders from heaven, %n%! We are, under no circumstances, allowed to open Pandora's box! I wonder why...?
45461	#821$$1#Do you like me, %n%? If you do, how about a gift? Tee-hee!
45462	#826$$1#Good angels aren't supposed to be greedy. I'm not greedy, I just like to enjoy life.
45463	#827$$1#Do you think I'm a bad angel, %n%? Is that why you gave me this? I'm... hurt.
45464	#827$$1#This... this isn't what I asked for! Do you really love me?! Have you completely forgotten what I like?
45465	#822$$1#If I'm a good little angel, %n%, will you give me a present? Pretty please?
45466	#824$$1#I told heaven yesterday that I like you the best, %n%. It's because you give the best gifts!
45467	#3$$1#You're true friend, %n%. Only you really appreciate my music!
45468	#824$$1#What an amazing gift, %n%! We'll be friends forever!
45469	#822$$1#I'm Flora. Pleased to meet you!
45470	#831$$1#Flowers are beautiful. Do you like flowers, %n%?
45471	#3$$1#Hmm... (contemplates a flower)
45472	#824$$1#Daria is always surrounded by roses. I really like her!
45473	#826$$1#I'm very worried about the destruction of the environment...
45474	#824$$1#Daria and Pandora may tease me all the time, but I don't mind. I'm actually quite happy!
45475	#821$$1#Whenever I'm down, looking at Spring blossoms always makes me feel better!
45476	#825$$1#Do you have a spare flower on you, %n%? Tee-hee!
45477	#827$$1#Dragomon are the worst, trampling the poor, helpless flowers... They have no respect for the environment!
45478	#831$$1#Daria looks like a majestic rose, and Matera is just like a bright sunflower. What flower do you resemble, %n%?
45479	#823$$1#Kiyomi is adorable. For someone so small, she's got a huge appetite!
45480	#822$$1#My heart is fragile like a flower, %n%. You won't hurt me, will you?
45481	#824$$1#%n%! Flower is my middle name!
45482	#831$$1#Will stop by to chat about flowers with me, %n%?
45483	#2$$1#You'll take care of me, won't you %n%?
45484	#825$$1#Atelia always tells me I'm cute, but I'd rather be beautiful like a flower in bloom!
45485	#831$$1#%n%, do you know someone called Marvin? He's always asking me to enchant his flowers. Any idea what he's up to?
45486	#824$$1#The world is a beautiful place, isn't it? I couldn't be happier!
45487	#822$$1#Will you take me somewhere with a bunch of flowers, %n%? That would make me very happy.
45488	#825$$1#The flowers are in bloom! What a wonderful time of year!
45489	#826$$1#I'm not too fond of this, %n%, but thanks anyway.
45490	#823$$1#I'm not too sure what this is for, but thanks anyway.
45491	#821$$1#Thanks, %n%. I've got the perfect use for this.
45492	#822$$1#What a perfect gift! You really do understand me! Thanks, %n%.
45493	#824$$1#This is the best! I'm touched...
45494	#824$$1#Thanks, %n%! You really spoil me...
45495	#821$$1#Hi, %n%. Do you know where Van Pelt and all the others have disappeared to?
45496	#824$$1#I'm still waiting on those parts I ordered...
45497	#824$$1#I'm the Falcon's mechanical genius!
45498	#825$$1#Jab, cross, hook... POW! Blood, sweat, and tears. That's being a man in a nutshell!
45499	#825$$1#Robotic Dragomon... just the idea gets my heart racing!
45500	#2$$1#Hey! That idiot Van Pelt left something here...
45501	#821$$1#Agatha is always overreacting. She's fine the way she is!
45502	#821$$1#It's great to be a part of an organization that shares the same ideals. I'll be a Falcon for life!
45503	#826$$1#Hey there, %n%! They don't call me Gearmaster for nothing!
45504	#3$$1#Well, if it isn't %n%!
45505	#826$$1#Hey, %n%. Make sure you don't step on my trap like Nash just did, haha!
45506	#822$$1#Rumor has it that Atelia's been a bit mischievous lately. I hope she doesn't get herself into too much trouble.
45507	#827$$1#Leader...? So that's what everyone thinks of me, haha!
45508	#821$$1#I'm busy raising money. Please don't bother me unless it's important!
45509	#827$$1#I don't care if you ignore me. I'm more than capable of taking care of myself.
45510	#821$$1#When will you go questing with me, %n%? I can't wait to try out my latest trap!
45511	#821$$1#Civilization is like a thin layer of ice upon a deep ocean of chaos and darkness. There will always be turmoil. How about lending me a hand, %n%?
45512	#821$$1#Hey %n%, if you've got the time, why don't you help out Lenora?
45513	#3$$1#Men have simple tastes. I'm not hard to please!
45514	#821$$1#I have a ton of things to sort out before I can move!
45515	#826$$1#I couldn't even use this as a spare part but... thanks?
45516	#823$$1#I'm all for recycling, but when it comes to gifts... 
45517	#821$$1#Oh, %n%! You remembered! I never expected this. Thanks a million! Haha!
45518	#825$$1#I have a laser trap that's just waiting for a part like this !
45519	#824$$1#Haha, thanks %n%! You have a great taste in gifts!
45520	#824$$1#It won't be long before I complete a new generation of robotic Dragomon!
45521	#822$$1#Alchemy is my heart and soul!
45522	#2$$1#Oh! You're a fan of my work, %n%?
45523	#825$$1#I have some groundbreaking alchemical theories to unveil at the next meeting!
45524	#824$$1#Hey %n%... Any idea who I should invite to the ball? How about you!? Hehe...
45525	#822$$1#Hey! Take a look at my latest technological innovation!
45526	#825$$1#%n%, I may seem cold at times, but deep down I really care about others!
45527	#824$$1#Haha, %n%! So you're a fan?! Naturally!
45528	#823$$1#I had a strange feeling in Elysium the other day, like someone was watching me...
45529	#827$$1#Hey %n%! Wanna talk alchemy?
45530	#826$$1#Why do I enjoy alchemy? Isn't it obvious? Because it's alchemy, silly!
45531	#2$$1#Fuse tem parts gold, five parts adamantine and... Huh? Do you need something?
45532	#821$$1#Sorry %n%. I've been a bit distracted lately. Is everything going well?
45533	#824$$1#You're looking mighty fine, %n%!
45534	#826$$1#You may have heard that I love playing pranks! So... don't get too offended. It's all in good fun!
45535	#827$$1#People think I'm narcissistic? I just like to look after myself!
45536	#824$$1#Do you have any single, good-looking friends? How about an introduction?
45537	#822$$1#Let me know if you'd like to learn alchemy. I promise I'll be gentle, haha!
45538	#822$$1#Hey %n%! When you're not busy questing, how about we meet for a cup of afternoon tea?
45539	#2$$1#I have something of a soft spot for pretty girls. Any leads?
45540	#824$$1#My bag is stuffed full of love letters from adoring fans! There's no room for anything else, haha!
45541	#825$$1#This is the byproduct of a failed alchemical experiment... How fascinating!
45542	#826$$1#I thought we were tight, like two peas in a pod. I guess I was wrong...
45543	#821$$1#Because we're so close, I'll be polite and accept it. Oh my...

45548	#2$$1#Want to get to know me a little better? You can start by paying more attention to me!
45549	#825$$1#I'm not in the mood! Just leave me alone...
45550	#821$$1#Being a jerk to people is a great way to relieve boredom.
45551	#3$$1#I'd love to meet Esh-Baal one day.
45552	#831$$1#Roses are the best. Don't you agree, %n%?

45559	#824$$1#You're so cute when you're angry! I love teasing you!
45560	#824$$1#I hid Cindell's umbrella. She's tearing her hair out looking for it. It's hilarious!
45561	#831$$1#I'm a bit preoccupied right now. Why don't you come back and chat later?
45562	#821$$1#Real work? Why don't you lighten up a bit. Now fighting... that I can do!

45581	#826$$1#Didn't anyone teach you to lower your head when speaking with royalty?
45582	#825$$1#Oh! You think I won't flatten you?
45583	#825$$1#Once a hunter came to challenge me. Instead of fighting honorably, she launched a sneak attack. I ended up teaching her a thing or two...
45584	#824$$1#So far, no one has been able to withstand my mastery of fire. Do you want to try, %n%?
45585	#822$$1#I always enjoy hearing from my subjects!

45591	#824$$1#Why don't you come and chat sometime?
45592	#821$$1#I'm busy with affairs of state. I'll send a summons for you later!

45777	#3$$1#Perhaps I could use the power of the moon to punish the enemy for you!
45778	#826$$1#I don't think I can even lift a finger at the moment....
45779	#827$$1#I can't be bothered to do anything right now...
45780	#823$$1#What's this for?

45873	#822$$1#Oh... I'm sorry. I lost concentration for a second there.
45874	#823$$1#I'm a little... afraid of Pandora. She changed into a cat!
45875	#822$$1#It's reassuring to see that Elysium is so prosperous.
45876	#831$$1#%n%Can you show me around town?
45877	#826$$1#Is the sea nearby?

45880	#831$$1#Droplet is always teasing me! She's so cute!
45881	#825$$1#Sometimes I want to take a break from being royalty, and just relax...
45882	#827$$1#Can you help me and Pandora? Don't look at me as if I were a piece of food...
45883	#821$$1#The wide ocean is so beautiful! %n%Would you like to go together?

45898	Here - a small token of appreciation, for everything you've done for me.
45899	#821$$1#You want to play with me? Ursa says you're suspicious, but I'm willing to give it a go...
45900	#826$$1#You want to play with Ursa? Ursa likes to play hard...
45901	#822$$1#Let's play!
45902	#823$$1#Harmonia has a beautiful voice. I want to sing like her...
45903	#822$$1#I love to play with dolls. They never make me angry.
45904	#831$$1#How boring! Can we go out?
45905	#826$$1#Ursa scares off anyone who tries to bully me. You won't try to bully me, will you?
45906	#824$$1#When I'm angry, Ursa also gets angry, and punishes whoever it was who upset me.
45907	#824$$1#Pandora broke my doll! Next time I meet her, I'm going to turn her into a doll!
45908	#831$$1#Garth's robot is not at all cute. Maybe we could add some dolls!
45909	#825$$1#You're interesting, and you don't make me at all angry. You're great to hang out with!
45910	#827$$1#Ursa says you're invited for afternoon tea. Will you come?
45911	#821$$1#Elysium is gorgeous! All it's missing is a few more dolls!
45912	#821$$1#All the dolls need now is a soul...
45913	#824$$1#Ursa says that you'll hurt me. You won't hurt me, will you?
45914	#831$$1#Hahaha! Dolly, you're so funny!
45915	#821$$1#Ursa was the first doll I ever knitted. She's my best friend.
45916	#831$$1#Do you want to hold her? But only for a second!
45917	#824$$1#Strange... you're not a doll, but I like you.
45918	#822$$1#I can't accept any presents, otherwise Ursa'll get jealous.
45919	#826$$1#Hmm.... Alright then... Although Ursa and I don't like it that much...
45920	#821$$1#Do you want me to ask Ursa to thump you? You're tempting me!
45921	#824$$1#I like your present.
45922	#831$$1#Ursa. Store %n%'s present in a safe place. Don't let anyone take it!
45923	#823$$1#Is this for me? Wow, thanks a million!
45924	#824$$1#This is great! I'm going to put it in a safe place... just don't tell Ursa!
45925	Take it...I think it should help you.
45926	Ursa says she has a present to give me. Will you accept it?
